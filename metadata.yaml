description: '"This study deals with the portions of the three great Norse sagas which
  relate to the extreme north end of the mainland of Scotland--Orkneyinga, St. Magnus,
  and Hakon''s--and incorporates them with the scanty extant English and Scottish
  records to form a connected account, from the Scottish point of view, of the Norse
  occupations of most of the more fertile parts of Sutherland and Caithness from its
  beginning about 870 until its close, when these counties, along with the Hebrides,
  were incorporated into the kingdom of Scotland by treaty with Norway in 1266. Gray
  begins with a brief look at the Picts and the Northmen, and then moves on to a study
  of life under the Norse Jarls. There is extensive material on the families of: Duffus,
  Freskyn de Moravia, Gunn, Innes, Mackay, Oliphant, Ross, and Sutherland. Chapters
  include: The Early Norse Jarls; Thorfinn, Earl and Jarl; Paul and Erlend, Hakon
  and Magnus; The Moddan Family; Harold Maddadson and the Freskyns; Jarls David and
  John, Freskin II; The Succession to the Caithness Earldom; King Hakon''s Expedition
  and the North; and Results and Conclusions. There is as well a pedigree chart of
  the Freskyn family, and a full-color map of the region"--Container.'
