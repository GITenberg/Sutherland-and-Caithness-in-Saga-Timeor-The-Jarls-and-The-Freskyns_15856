  <h2>PREFACE.</h2>

  <p>Originally delivered as a Presidential Address to The Viking
  Society for Northern Research, the following pages, as amplified
  and revised, are published mainly with the object of interesting
  Sutherland and Caithness people in the early history of their
  native counties, and particularly in the three Sagas which bear
  upon it as well as on that of Orkney and Shetland at a time
  regarding which Scottish records almost wholly fail us.</p>

  <p>When, however, these records are extant, use has been made of
  them together with later books upon them, of which a list
  follows, and to which references are given in the notes.</p>

  <p>A special effort has been made to deal with the vexed question
  of the succession to the Caithness Earldom after Earl John's
  death in 1231, with the pedigree of the first known ancestors of
  the House of Sutherland, and with the mystery of the descent of
  Lady Johanna of Strathnaver.</p>

  <p>Acknowledgments of assistance received are tendered to the
  writers of the books above referred to, but thanks are specially
  due to Mr. A.W. JOHNSTON, Founder and Past President of the
  Viking Society, for numerous hints, and for making the Index; to
  Mr. JON STEFANNSON for reading the manuscript; and to Mr. ALAN O.
  ANDERSON, whose knowledge of the English and Scottish Records of
  the period is as accurate as it is extensive, and who has made
  several valuable suggestions.</p>

  <p>But for the opinions expressed no one save the writer is
  responsible, and, where records are scanty, much has necessarily
  been left to conjecture.</p>

  <h3>Introductory.</h3>

  <p>In the following pages an attempt is made to fit together
  facts derived, on the one hand, from those portions of the
  Orkneyinga, St. Magnus and Hakonar Sagas which relate to the
  extreme north end of the mainland of Scotland, and, on the other
  hand, from such scanty English and Scottish records, bearing on
  its history, as have survived, so as to form a connected account,
  from the Scottish point of view, of the Norse occupation of most
  of the more fertile parts of Sutherland and Caithness from its
  beginning about 870 until its close, when these counties were
  freed from Norse influence, and Man and the Hebrides were
  incorporated in the kingdom of Scotland by treaty with Norway in
  1266.</p>

  <p>References to the authorities mentioned above and to later
  works bearing on the subject have been inserted in the hope that
  others, more leisured and more competent, may supplement them by
  further research, and convert those portions of the narrative
  which are at present largely conjectural from story into
  history.</p>

  <p>What manner of men the prehistoric races which in early ages
  successively inhabited the northern end of the Scottish mainland
  may have been, we can now hardly imagine. Dr. Joseph Anderson's
  classical volumes<a id="footnotetag3" name=
  "footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>1</sup></a> on
  <i>Scotland in Pagan Times</i> tell us something, indeed all that
  can now be known, of some of <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page2" id="page2"></a>[pg 2]</span> them, and in the Royal
  Commission's<a id="footnotetag4" name="footnotetag4"></a><a href=
  "#footnote4"><sup>2</sup></a> <i>Reports and Inventories of the
  Early Monuments</i> of Sutherland and of Caithness respectively,
  Mr. Curle has classified their visible remains, and may, let us
  hope, with the aid of legislation, save those relics from the
  roadmaker or dykebuilder. Lastly, such superstitions, or
  survivals of beliefs, as remain in the north of Scotland from
  early days have been collected, arranged, and explained by the
  late Mr. George Henderson in an able book on that subject.<a id=
  "footnotetag5" name="footnotetag5"></a><a href=
  "#footnote5"><sup>3</sup></a> Enquiries such as these, however,
  belong to the provinces of arch&#230;ology and
  folk-psychology, and not to that of history, still less to that
  of contemporary history, which began in the north, as elsewhere,
  with oral tradition, handed down at first by men of recording
  memories, and then committed to writing, and afterwards to print;
  and both in Norway and Iceland on the one hand, and in the
  Highlands on the other such men were by no means rare, and were
  deservedly held in the highest honour.</p>

  <p>Writing arrived in Sutherland and Caithness very late, and was
  not even then a common indigenous product. Clerks, or scholars
  who could read and write, were at first very few, and in the
  north of Scotland hardly any such were known before the twelfth
  century of our era, save perhaps in the Pictish and Columban
  settlements of hermits and missionaries. Of their writings, if
  they ever existed, little or nothing of historical value is
  extant at the present time. But the <i>Orkneyinga, St.
  Magnus</i>, and <i>Hakon's Sagas</i>, when they take up their
  story, present us with a graphic and human and consecutive
  account of much which would otherwise have remained unknown, and
  their story, though tinged here and there with romance through
  the writers' desire for dramatic effect, is, so far as the main
  facts go, singularly faithful and accurate, when it can be tested
  by contemporary chronicles.</p>

  <p>Until the twelfth or the thirteenth century, save for
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg
  3]</span> these Sagas, we learn hardly anything of Sutherland,
  or, indeed, of the extreme north of Scotland from any record
  written either by anyone living there or by anyone with local
  knowledge, and for facts before those given in the <i>Orkneyinga
  Saga</i> we have to cast about among historians of the Roman
  Empire and amongst early Greek geographers, or later
  ecclesiastical writers, to find nothing save a few names of
  places and some scattered references to vanished races, tongues
  and Churches. For information about the Picts we have at first to
  rely on the researches of some of our trustworthy
  arch&#230;ologists, and at a later date on the annals,
  largely Irish, collected by the late Mr. Skene in his
  <i>Chronicles of the Picts and Scots</i>, and in the works of Mr.
  Ritson, into which it is no part of our purpose to enter in
  detail. All the authorities for early Scottish history have been
  ably dealt with by Sir Herbert Maxwell in his book on the
  <i>Early Chronicles Relating to Scotland</i>, reproducing the
  Rhind lectures delivered by him in 1912. At the end of our period
  reliable references to charters from the twelfth century onwards
  will be found in <i>Origines Parochiales Scotiae</i>, and
  especially in the second part of the second volume of that
  valuable work of monumental research, produced, under the late
  Mr. Cosmo Innes, by Mr. James Brichan, and presented to the
  Bannatyne Club by the second Duke of Sutherland and the late Sir
  David Dundas. There are also the reprints, often with elaborate
  notes, of Scottish Charters by Sir Archibald C. Lawrie, The
  Bannatyne Club, The Spalding Club, The Viking Society, Mr. Alan
  O. Anderson, and others. The first volume of the Orkney and
  Shetland Records published by the Viking Society is prefaced by
  an able introduction of great interest.</p>

  <p>By way of introduction to Norse times, we may attempt to state
  very shortly some of the leading events in Caledonia in Roman,
  Pictish, and Scottish times <span class="pagenum"><a name="page4"
  id="page4"></a>[pg 4]</span> from near the end of the first
  century to the beginning of the tenth, so far as they bear on the
  agencies at work there in Norse times.</p>

  <p>The first four of the nine centuries above referred to had
  seen the Romans under Agricola<a id="footnotetag6" name=
  "footnotetag6"></a><a href="#footnote6"><sup>4</sup></a> in 80 to
  84 A.D. attempt, and fail, to conquer the Caledonians or men of
  the woods,<a id="footnotetag7" name="footnotetag7"></a><a href=
  "#footnote7"><sup>5</sup></a> whose home, as their name implies,
  was the great woodland region of the Mounth or Grampians. Those
  centuries had also seen the building of the wall of Hadrian
  between the Tyne and Solway in the year 120, the campaigns of
  Lollius Urbicus in 140 A.D. and the erection between the Firths
  of Forth and Clyde of the earthen rampart of Antonine on stone
  foundations, which was held by Rome for about fifty years.
  Seventy years later, in the year 210, fifty thousand Roman
  legionaries had perished in the Caledonian campaigns of the Roman
  Emperor Severus, and over a century and a half later, in 368,
  there had followed the second conquest of the Roman province of
  Valentia which comprised the Lothians and Galloway in the south,
  by Theodosius. Lastly, the final retirement of the Romans from
  Scotland, and indeed from Britain, took place, on the destruction
  of the Roman Empire in spite of Stilicho's noble defence, by
  Alaric and the Visigoths, in 410.</p>

  <p>From the Roman wars and occupation two main results followed.
  The various Caledonian tribes inhabiting the land had then
  probably for the first time joined forces to fight a common foe,
  and in fighting him had become for that purpose temporarily
  united. Again, possibly as part of the high Roman policy of
  Stilicho, St. Ninian had in the beginning of the fifth century
  introduced into Galloway and also into the regions north of the
  Wall of Antonine the first teachers of Christianity, a religion
  which, however, was for some time longer to remain unknown to the
  Picts generally in the north. But, as Professor Hume Brown also
  tells <span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg
  5]</span> us in the first of the three entrancing volumes of his
  History, "In Scotland, if we may judge from the meagre accounts
  that have come down to us, the Roman dominion hardly passed the
  stage of a military occupation, held by an intermittent and
  precarious tenure." What concerns dwellers in the extreme north
  is that although the Romans went into Perthshire and may have
  temporarily penetrated even into Moray, they certainly never
  occupied any part of Sutherland or Caithness, though their
  tablets of brass, probably as part of the currency used in trade,
  have been found in a Sutherland Pictish tower or broch,<a id=
  "footnotetag9" name="footnotetag9"></a><a href=
  "#footnote9"><sup>7</sup></a> a fact which goes far to prove that
  the brochs, with which we shall deal later on, existed in Roman
  times.<a id="footnotetag10" name="footnotetag10"></a><a href=
  "#footnote10"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

  <p>As the Romans never occupied Sutherland or Caithness or even
  came near their borders, their inhabitants were never disarmed or
  prevented from the practice of war, and thus enfeebled like the
  more southerly Britons.</p>

  <p>After the departure, in 410, of the Romans, St. Ninian sent
  his missionaries over Pictland, but darkness broods over its
  history thenceforward for a hundred and fifty years. Picts, Scots
  of Ireland, Angles and Saxons swarmed southwards, eastwards, and
  westwards respectively into England, and ruined Romano-British
  civilisation, which the Britons, unskilled in arms, were
  powerless to defend, as the lamentations of Gildas abundantly
  attest.</p>

  <p>In 563 Columba, the Irish soldier prince and missionary, whose
  Life by Adamnan still survives,<a id="footnotetag11" name=
  "footnotetag11"></a><a href="#footnote11"><sup>9</sup></a> landed
  in Argyll from Ulster, introduced another form of Christian
  worship, also, like the Pictish, "without reference to the Church
  of Rome," and from his base in Iona not only preached and sent
  preachers to the north-western and northern Picts, but in some
  measure brought among them the higher civilisation then
  prevailing in Ireland. About the same time Kentigern, or St.
  Mungo, a Briton of Wales, carried on missionary <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg 6]</span> work in
  Strathclyde and in Pictland, and even, it is said, sent preachers
  to Orkney.</p>

  <p>In the beginning of the seventh century King Aethelfrith of
  Northumbria had cut the people of the Britons, who held the whole
  of west Britain from Devon to the Clyde, into two, the northern
  portion becoming the Britons of Strathclyde; and the same king
  defeated Aidan, king of the Scots of Argyll, at Degsastan near
  Jedburgh, though Aidan survived, and, with the help of Columba,
  re-established the power of the Scots in Argyll.</p>

  <p>About the year 664, the wars in the south with Northumbria
  resulted in the introduction by its king Oswy into south Pictland
  of the Catholic instead of the Columban Church, a change which
  Nechtan, king of the Southern Picts, afterwards confirmed, and
  which long afterwards led to the abandonment throughout Scotland
  of the Pictish and Columban systems, and to the adoption in their
  place of the wider and broader culture, and the politically
  superior organisation and stricter discipline of the Catholic
  Church, as new bishoprics were gradually founded throughout
  Scotland by its successive kings.<a id="footnotetag12" name=
  "footnotetag12"></a><a href="#footnote12"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

  <p>Meantime, during the centuries which elapsed before the
  Catholic Church reached the extreme north of Scotland, the
  Pictish and Columban churches held the field, as rivals, there,
  and probably never wholly perished in Norse times even in
  Caithness and Sutherland.</p>

  <p>During these centuries there were constant wars among the
  Picts themselves, and later between them and the Scots,
  resulting, generally, in the Picts being driven eastward and
  northward from the south centre of Alban, which the Scots seized,
  into the Grampian hills.</p>

  <p>After this very brief statement of previous history we may now
  attempt to give some description of the land and the people of
  Caithness and Sutherland as the Northmen found them in the ninth
  century.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id=
  "page7"></a>[pg 7]</span>

  <h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

  <h3>The Pict and the Northman.</h3>

  <p>The present counties of Caithness and Sutherland A together
  made up the old Province of Cait or Cat, so called after the name
  of one of the seven legendary sons of <i>Cruithne</i>, the
  eponymous hero who represented the Picts of Alban, as the whole
  mainland north of the Forth was then called, and whose seven
  sons' names were said to stand for its seven main
  divisions,<a id="footnotetag13" name="footnotetag13"></a><a href=
  "#footnote13"><sup>1</sup></a> <i>Cait</i> for Caithness and
  Sutherland, <i>Ce</i> for Keith or Mar, <i>Cirig</i> for
  Magh-Circinn or Mearns, <i>Fib</i> for Fife, <i>Fidach</i>
  (Woody) for Moray, <i>Fotla</i> for Ath-Fodla or Athol, and
  <i>Fortrenn</i> for Menteith.</p>

  <p>Immediately to the south of Cat lay the great province of
  Moray including Ross, and, in the extreme west, a part of north
  Argyll; and the boundary between Cat and Ross was approximately
  the tidal River Oykel, called by the Norse Ekkjal, the northern
  and perhaps also the southern bank of which probably formed the
  ranges of hills known in the time of the earliest Norse jarls as
  Ekkjals-bakki. Everywhere else Cat was bounded by the open sea,
  of which the Norse soon became masters, namely on the west by the
  Minch, on the north by the North Atlantic and Pentland Firth, and
  on the east and south by the North Sea; and the great valley of
  the Oykel and the Dornoch Firth made Cat almost into an
  island.</p>

  <p>Like C&#230;sar's Gaul, Cat was "divided into three
  parts"; first, <i>Ness</i>, which was co-extensive with the
  modern county of Caithness, a treeless land, excellent in crops
  and highly cultivated in the north-east, but elsewhere mainly
  made up of peat mosses, flagstones and flatness, save in its
  western and south-western borderland of hills; secondly, to the
  west of Ness, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8">
  </a>[pg 8]</span> <i>Strathnavern</i>, a land of dales
  and hills, and, especially in its western parts, of peaks; and,
  thirdly, to the south of Strathnavern, <i>Sudrland</i>, or the
  Southland, a riviera of pastoral links and fertile ploughland,
  sheltered on the north by its own forests and hills, and sloping,
  throughout its whole length from the Oykel to the Ord of
  Caithness, towards the <i>Breithisjorthr</i>, Broadfjord, or
  Moray Firth, its southern sea.<a id="footnotetag14" name=
  "footnotetag14"></a><a href="#footnote14"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

  <p>Save in north-east Ness, and in favoured spots elsewhere, also
  below the 500 feet level, the land of Cat was a land of heath and
  woods<a id="footnotetag15" name="footnotetag15"></a><a href=
  "#footnote15"><sup>3</sup></a> and rocks, studded, especially in
  the west, with lochs abounding in trout, a vast area of rolling
  moors, intersected by spacious straths, each with its salmon
  river, a land of solitary silences, where red deer and elk
  abounded, and in which the wild boar and wolf ranged freely, the
  last wolf being killed in Glen Loth within twelve miles of
  Dunrobin at a date between 1690 and 1700.<a id="footnotetag16"
  name="footnotetag16"></a><a href="#footnote16"><sup>4</sup></a>
  No race of hunters or fishermen ever surpassed the Picts in their
  craft as such.</p>

  <p>The land, especially Sutherland, is still a happy
  hunting-ground not only for the sportsman but also for the
  antiquary. For the modern County of Sutherland is outwardly much
  the same now as it was in Pictish times, save for road and rail,
  two castles, and a sprinkling of shooting lodges, inns, and good
  cottages, which, however, in so vast a territory are, as the
  Irishman put it, "mere fleabites on the ocean." Much of the west
  of the land of Cat was scarcely inhabited at all in Pictish or
  Viking days, because as is clearly the case in the Kerrow-Garrow
  or Rough Quarter of Eddrachilles, it would not carry one sheep or
  feed one human being per hundred acres in many parts. The rest of
  it also remains practically unchanged in appearance from the
  earliest days till the present time, as it has been little
  disturbed by the plough save in the north-east of Ness and at
  Lairg and Kinbrace, and in its lower levels along <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg 9]</span> the coast.
  But Loch Fleet no longer reaches to Pittentrail, and the crooked
  bay at Crakaig has been drained and the Water of Loth sent
  straight to the sea.</p>

  <p>The only buildings or structures existing in Cat in Pictish
  and early Norse times were a few vitrified forts, some
  underground erde-houses, hut-circles innumerable, and perhaps a
  hundred and fifty brochs, or Pictish towers as they are popularly
  called, which had been erected at various dates from the first
  century onwards, long before the advent of the Norse Vikings is
  on record, as defences against wolves and raiders both by land
  and sea, and especially by sea. Notwithstanding agricultural
  operations, foundations of 145 brochs can still be traced in Ness
  and 67 in Strathnavern and Sudrland, but they were not all in use
  at the same time, and they are mostly on sites taken over later
  on by the Norse,<a id="footnotetag17" name=
  "footnotetag17"></a><a href="#footnote17"><sup>5</sup></a>
  because they were already cultivated and agriculturally the
  best.</p>

  <p>A well-known authority on such subjects, the late Dr. Munro,
  in his <i>Prehistoric Scotland</i> p. 389 writes of the brochs as
  follows:&mdash;"Some four hundred might have been seen
  conspicuously dotting the more fertile lands along the shores and
  straths of the counties of Caithness, Sutherland, Ross,
  Inverness, Argyll, the islands of Orkney, Shetland, Bute, and
  some of the Hebrides. Two are found in Forfarshire, and one each
  in the counties of Perth, Stirling, Midlothian, Selkirk and
  Berwick."</p>

  <p>If one may venture to hazard a conjecture as to their date,
  they probably came into general use in these parts of Caledonia
  as nearly as possible contemporaneously with the date of the
  Roman occupation of South Britain, which they outlasted for many
  centuries. But their erection was not due to the fear of attack
  by the armies of Rome. For their remains are found where the
  Romans never came, and where the Romans came almost none are
  found. Their construction is more probably <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg 10]</span> to be
  ascribed to very early unrecorded maritime raids of pirates of
  unknown race both on regions far north of the eastern coast
  protected later by the Count of the Saxon shore, and on the
  northern and western islands and coasts, where also many ruins of
  them survive.</p>

  <p>In Cat dwelt the Pecht or Pict, the Brugaidh or farmer in his
  dun or broch, erected always on or near well selected fertile
  land on the seaboard, on the sides of straths, or on the shores
  of lochs, or less frequently on islands near their shores and
  then approached by causeways;<a id="footnotetag18" name=
  "footnotetag18"></a><a href="#footnote18"><sup>6</sup></a> and
  the rest of the people lived in huts whose circular foundations
  still remain, and are found in large numbers at much higher
  elevations than the sites of any brochs. The brochs near the
  sea-coast were often so placed as to communicate with each other
  for long distances up the valleys, by signal by day, and beacon
  fire at night, and so far as they are traceable, the positions of
  most of them in Sutherland and Caithness are indicated on the map
  by circles.</p>

  <p>Built invariably solely of stone and without mortar, in form
  the brochs were circular, and have been described as truncated
  cones with the apex cut off,<a id="footnotetag19" name=
  "footnotetag19"></a><a href="#footnote19"><sup>7</sup></a> and
  their general plan and elevation were everywhere almost uniform.
  The ground floor was solid masonry, but contained small chambers
  in its thickness of about 15 feet. Above the ground floor the
  broch consisted of two concentric walls about three feet apart,
  the whole rising to a height in the larger towers of 45 feet or
  more, with slabs of stone laid horizontally across the gap
  between and within the two walls, at intervals of, say, five or
  six feet up to the top, and thus forming a series of galleries
  inside the concentric walls, in which large numbers of human
  beings could be temporarily sheltered and supplies in great
  quantities could be stored for a siege. These galleries were
  approached from within the broch by a staircase which rose from
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg
  11]</span> the court and passed round between the two concentric
  walls above the ground floor, till it reached their highest
  point, and probably ended immediately above the only entrance,
  the outside of which was thus peculiarly exposed to missiles from
  the end of the staircase at the top of the broch. The only
  aperture in the outer wall was the entrance from the outside,
  about 5 feet high by 3 feet wide, fitted with a stone door, and
  protected by guard-chambers immediately within it, and it
  afforded the sole means of ingress to and egress from the
  interior court, for man and beast and goods and chattels alike.
  The circular court, which was formed inside, varied from 20 to 36
  feet in diameter, and was not roofed over; and the galleries and
  stairs were lighted only by slits, all looking into the court, in
  which, being without a roof, fires could be lit. In some few
  there were wells, but water-supply, save when the broch was in a
  loch, must have been a difficulty in most cases during a
  prolonged siege.</p>

  <p>In these brochs the farmer lived, and his women-kind span and
  wove and plied their querns or hand-mills, and, in raids, they
  shut themselves up, and possibly some of their poorer neighbours
  took refuge in the brochs, deserting their huts and crowding into
  the broch; but of this practice there is no evidence, and the
  nearest hut-circles are often far from the remains of any
  broch.</p>

  <p>For defence the broch was as nearly as possible perfect
  against any engines or weapons then available for attacking it;
  and we may note that it existed in Scotland and mainly in the
  north and west of it, and nowhere else in the world.<a id=
  "footnotetag20" name="footnotetag20"></a><a href=
  "#footnote20"><sup>8</sup></a> It was a roofless block-house,
  aptly described by Dr. Joseph Anderson as a "safe." It could not
  be battered down or set on fire, and if an enemy got inside it,
  he would find himself in a sort of trap surrounded by the
  defenders of the broch, and a mark for their missiles. The broch,
  too, was quite <span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id=
  "page12"></a>[pg 12]</span> distinct from the lofty, narrow
  ecclesiastical round tower, of which examples still are found in
  Ireland, and in Scotland at Brechin and Abernethy.</p>

  <p>To resist invasion the Picts would be armed with spears, short
  swords and dirks, but, save perhaps a targe, were without
  defensive body armour, which they scorned to use in battle,
  preferring to fight stripped. They belonged to septs and clans,
  and each sept would have its Maor, and each clan or province its
  Maormor<a id="footnotetag21" name="footnotetag21"></a><a href=
  "#footnote21"><sup>9</sup></a> or big chief, succession being
  derived through females, a custom which no doubt originated in
  remote pre-Christian ages when the paternity of children was
  uncertain.</p>

  <p>Being Celts, the Picts would shun the open sea. They feared
  it, for they had no chance on it, as their vessels were often
  merely hides stretched on wattles, resembling enlarged coracles.
  Yet with such rude ships as they had, they reached Orkney,
  Shetland, the Faroes and Iceland as hermits or
  missionaries.<a id="footnotetag22" name=
  "footnotetag22"></a><a href="#footnote22"><sup>10</sup></a> In
  Norse times they never had the mastery of the sea, and the
  Pictish navy is a myth of earlier days.<a id="footnotetag23"
  name="footnotetag23"></a><a href=
  "#footnote23"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

  <p>Lastly, as we have seen, the Picts of Cat had never been
  conquered, nor had their land ever been occupied by the legions
  of Rome, which had stopped at the furthest in Moray; and the sole
  traces of Rome in Cat are, as stated, two plates of hammered
  brass found in a Sutherland broch, and some Samian ware. Further,
  Christian though he had been long before Viking times, the Pict
  of Cat derived his Christianity at first and chiefly from the
  Pictish missions, and later from the Columban Church, both
  without reference to Papal Rome; and his missionaries not only
  settled on islands off his coasts, but later on worshipped in his
  small churches on the mainland; and many a Pictish saint of holy
  life was held in reverence there.</p>

  <p>About the eighth century and probably earlier, immigrants from
  the southern shores of the Baltic pressed <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg 13]</span> the
  Norse westwards in Norway, and later on over-population in the
  sterile lands which lie along Norway's western shores, drove its
  inhabitants forth from its western fjords north of Stavanger and
  from The Vik or great bay of the Christiania Fjord, whence they
  may have derived their name of Vikings, across the North Sea to
  the opposite coasts of Shetland, Orkney and Cat, where they found
  oxen and sheep to slaughter on the nesses or headlands, and
  stores of grain, and some silver and even gold in the shrines and
  on the persons of those whom they attacked, and in still later
  days they sought new lands over the sea and permanent
  settlements, where they would have no scat to pay to any overlord
  or feudal superior.</p>

  <p>When the Vikings landed, superior discipline, instilled into
  them by their training on board ship, superior arms, the long
  two-handed sword and the spear and battle-axe and their deadly
  bows and arrows, and superior defensive armour, the long shield,
  the helmet and chain-mail, would make them more than a match for
  their adversaries.<a id="footnotetag24" name=
  "footnotetag24"></a><a href="#footnote24"><sup>12</sup></a> Above
  all, the greater ferocity of these Northmen, ruthlessly directed
  to its object by brains of the highest order, would render the
  Pictish farmer, who had wife and children, and home and cattle
  and crops to save, an easy prey to the Viking warrior bands, and
  the security of his broch would of itself tend to a passive and
  inactive, rather than an offensive, and therefore successful
  defence.</p>

  <p>After long continued raids, the Vikings no doubt saw that much
  of the land along the shore was fair and fertile compared with
  their own, and finally they came not merely to plunder and
  depart, but to settle and stay. When they did so, they came in
  large numbers and with organised forces<a id="footnotetag25"
  name="footnotetag25"></a><a href="#footnote25"><sup>13</sup></a>
  and carefully prepared plans of campaign, and with great reserves
  of weapons on board their ships; and having the ocean as their
  highway, they could select their points of attack. They
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg
  14]</span> then, as we know from the localities which bear their
  place-names, cleared out the Pict from most of his brochs and
  from the best land in Cat, shown on the map by dark green colour,
  that is, from all cultivated land below the 500 feet level save
  the upper parts of the valleys; or they slew or enslaved the Pict
  who remained. Lastly, on settling, they would seize his
  women-kind and wed them; for the women of their own race were not
  allowed on Viking ships, and were probably less amenable and less
  charming to boot. But the Pictish women thus seized had their
  revenge. The darker race prevailed, and, the supply of fathers of
  pure Norse blood being renewed only at intervals, the children of
  such unions soon came to be mainly of Celtic strain, and their
  mothers doubtless taught them to speak the Gaelic, which had then
  for at least a century superseded the Pictish tongue. The result
  was a mixed race of Gall-gaels or Gaelic strangers, far more
  Celtic than Norse, who soon spoke chiefly Gaelic, save in
  north-east Ness. Their Gaelic, too, like the English of Shetland
  at the present time, would not only be full of old Norse words,
  especially for things relating to the sea, but be spoken with a
  slight foreign accent. How numerous those foreign words still are
  in Sutherland Gaelic, the late Mr. George Henderson has ably and
  elaborately proved in his scholarly book on "Norse Influence on
  Celtic Scotland." We find traces of Norse words and the Norse
  accent and inflexions also on the Moray seaboard, on which the
  Norse gained a hold. The same would be true of the people on the
  western lands and islands of the Hebrides.</p>

  <p>As time went on, the Gaelic strain predominated more and more,
  especially on the mainland of Scotland, over the Gall, or
  foreign, strain, which was not maintained. Mr. A.W. Johnston, in
  his "<i>Orkney and Shetland Folk&mdash;850 to 1350</i>,"<a id=
  "footnotetag26" name="footnotetag26"></a><a href=
  "#footnote26"><sup>14</sup></a> has worked out the <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg 15]</span>
  quarterings of the Norse jarls, of whom only the first three were
  pure Norsemen, and he has thus shown conclusively how very Celtic
  they had become long before their male line failed. The same
  process was at work, probably to a greater extent, among those of
  lower rank, who could not find or import Norse wives, if they
  would, as the jarls frequently did.</p>

  <p>One or two other introductory points remain to be noted and
  borne in mind throughout.</p>

  <p>We must beware of thinking that all the land in an earldom
  such as Cat was the absolute property of the chief, as in the
  nineteenth century, or the latter half of it, was practically
  true in the modern county of Sutherland. The fact was very much
  otherwise. The Maormor and afterwards the earl doubtless had
  demesne lands, but he was in early times, <i>ex officio</i>,
  mainly a superior and receiver of dues for his king;<a id=
  "footnotetag27" name="footnotetag27"></a><a href=
  "#footnote27"><sup>15</sup></a> and this possibly shows why very
  early Scottish earldoms, as for instance that of Sutherland, in
  the absence of male heirs, often descended to females, unless the
  grant or custom excluded them. It was quite different with later
  feudal baronies or tenancies, where military service, which only
  males could render, was due, and which with rare exceptions it
  was, after about 1130, the policy of the Scottish kings to
  create; and in the case of baronies or lordships the land itself
  was often described and given to the grantee and his heirs by
  metes and bounds, in return for specified military service, and
  his heirs male were exhausted before any female could
  inherit.</p>

  <p>In Ness and in the rest of Cat there were many Norse and
  native holders of land within the earldom, and much tribal
  ownership. Duncan of Duncansby or Dungall of Dungallsby, as he is
  variously called, allowed part at least of his dominions to pass
  by marriage to the Norse jarls; but both Moddan and Earl Ottar,
  whose heir was Earl Erlend Haraldson, who <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg 16]</span> left no
  heir, owned land extensively in Ness and elsewhere, while Moddan
  "in Dale" had daughters also owning land, one of whom, Frakark,
  widow of Liot Nidingr, had many homesteads in upper Kildonan in
  Sudrland and elsewhere, and possibly it is her sister Helga's
  name that lingers in a place-name lower down that strath near
  Helmsdale, at Helgarie.</p>

  <p>What is worthy of notice is that it is clear from the
  place-names that after the Norse conquest the Norse held and
  named most of the lower or seaward parts of the valleys and
  nearly all the coast lands of Cat and Ross as far south as the
  Beauly Firth, and the Picts occupied and were never dispossessed
  of the upper parts of the valleys or the hills all through the
  Norse occupation. In other words, as conquerors coming from the
  sea, the Norsemen seized and held the better Pictish lands near
  the coast, which had been cultivated for centuries, and on which
  crops would ripen with regularity and certainty year after year.
  But as time went on the Pictish Maormor pressed the Norse Jarl
  more and more outwards and eastwards in Cat.</p>

  <p>We must also remember the enormous power of the Scottish Crown
  through its right of granting wardships, especially in the case
  of a female heir. Under such grants the grantee, usually some
  very powerful noble, took over during minority the title of his
  ward and all his revenues absolutely, in return for a payment,
  correspondingly large, to the Crown. If the ward was a female,
  the grantee disposed of her hand in marriage as well.</p>

  <p>After these preliminary notes, we may now again glance at the
  Scots, who were destined, from small beginnings, by a series of
  strange turns of fortune and superior state-craft, in time to
  conquer and dominate all modern Scotland north of the Forth, then
  known as Alban.</p>

  <p>The Scots, as already stated, had come over from <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg 17]</span> Ulster
  and settled in Cantyre about the end of the fifth century, and
  for long they had only the small Dalriadic territory of Argyll,
  and even this they all but lost more than once. At the same time,
  after 563, they had a most valuable asset in Columba, their
  soldier missionary prince, and his <i>milites Christi</i>, or
  soldiers of Christ, who gradually carried their Christianity and
  Irish culture even up to Orkney itself, with many a school of the
  Erse or Gaelic tongue, and thus paved the way for the
  consolidation of the whole of Alban into one political unit by
  providing its people with a common language.</p>

  <p>But in order to live the Scots had been forced to defeat many
  foes, such as the Britons of Strathclyde, whose capital was at
  Alcluyd or Dunbarton,<a id="footnotetag28" name=
  "footnotetag28"></a><a href="#footnote28"><sup>16</sup></a> the
  Northumbrians on the south, and the Picts of Atholl, Forfar, Fife
  and Kincardine, which comprised most of the fertile land south of
  the Grampians. The great Pictish province of Moray on the north
  of the Grampians, however, remained unsubdued, and it took the
  Scots several centuries more to reduce it.</p>

  <p>It was when the Scottish conquests above referred to were thus
  far completed that the new factor, with which we are mainly
  concerned, was introduced into the problem. This factor was, as
  stated, <i>the Northmen</i>.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

  <h3>The Early Norse Jarls.</h3>

  <p>It was in the reign of Constantine I, son of the great Pictish
  king, Angus MacFergus, that the new and disturbing influence
  mentioned above appeared in force in Alban. Favoured in their
  voyages to and fro by the prevailing winds, which then, as now,
  blew from the east in the spring and from the west later in the
  year, the Northmen, both Norsemen and Danes, neither being
  Christians, had, like their predecessors the Saxons and Angles
  and Frisians, for some time made trading voyages and desultory
  piratical attacks in summer-time on the coasts of Britain and
  Ireland, and probably many a short-lived settlement as well. But
  as these attacks and settlements are unrecorded in Cat, no
  account of them can be given.</p>

  <p>In 793 it is on record that the Vikings first sacked Iona,
  originally the centre of Columban Christianity but then
  Romanised, and they repeated these raids on its shrine again and
  again within the next fifteen years. Constantine thereupon
  removed its clergy to Dunkeld, "and there set up in his own
  kingdom an ecclesiastical capital for Scots and Picts
  alike,"<a id="footnotetag29" name="footnotetag29"></a><a href=
  "#footnote29"><sup>1</sup></a> as a step towards the political
  union of his realm, which Norse sea-power had completely severed
  from the original home of the Scots in Ulster.</p>

  <p>The Northmen now began the systematic maritime invasions of
  our eastern and northern and western coasts and islands, which
  history has recorded. North Scotland was attacked almost
  exclusively by Norsemen, and Norsemen and Danes invaded Ireland.
  The Danes seized the south of Scotland, and the north of
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg
  19]</span> England, of which latter country, early in the
  eleventh century in the time of King Knut, they were destined to
  dominate two-thirds, while Old Norse became the <i>lingua
  franca</i> of his English kingdom, and enriched its language with
  hundreds of Norse words, and gave us many new place and personal
  names.</p>

  <p>In 844, Kenneth, king of the Scots, the small North Irish sept
  which, as stated above, had crossed over from Erin and held the
  Dalriadic kingdom of Argyll with its capital at Dunadd near the
  modern Crinan Canal, succeeded in making good his title, on his
  mother's side, to the Pictish crown by a successful attack from
  the west on the southern Picts<a id="footnotetag30" name=
  "footnotetag30"></a><a href="#footnote30"><sup>2</sup></a> at the
  same time as their territory was being invaded from the east
  coast by the Danes. Thereafter, these Picts and the Scots
  gradually became and ever afterwards remained one nation, a
  course which suited both peoples as a safeguard not only against
  their foreign foes the Northmen, but also against the Berenicians
  of Lothian on the south. With the object of ensuring the union of
  the two peoples Kenneth is said to have transferred some of the
  relics of Columba, who had become the patron saint of both, from
  Iona to Dunkeld, which thus definitely remained not only the
  ecclesiastical capital of the united Picts and Scots, but the
  common centre of their religious sentiment and veneration.
  Incidentally, too, the Pictish language gradually became disused,
  as that people were absorbed in the Scots; and unfortunately,
  through the fact that no written literature survived to preserve
  it, that language has almost entirely disappeared. The better
  opinion is that it was more closely akin to Welsh and Breton than
  to Erse or Gaelic, the Welsh and the Picts being termed "P"
  Celts, and the other races "Q" Celts, because in words of the
  same meaning the Welsh used "P" where the Gaelic speaking Celt
  used the hard "C". For instance, "Pen" and "Map" in <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg 20]</span> Welsh
  became "Ken" (or Ceann) and "Mac" in Gaelic.<a id="footnotetag31"
  name="footnotetag31"></a><a href=
  "#footnote31"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

  <p>In the reign of Constantine II, Kenneth's son and next
  successor but one, further incursions by the Northmen took place
  under King Olaf the White of Dublin in 867 and 871; while in 875
  his son Thorstein the Red, by Aud "the deeply-wealthy" or
  "deeply-wise," landed on the north coast, and, we are told,
  seized "Caithness and Sutherland and Moray and more than half
  Scotland,"<a id="footnotetag32" name="footnotetag32"></a><a href=
  "#footnote32"><sup>4</sup></a> being killed, however, by
  treachery within the year. His mother Aud thereupon built a ship
  in Caithness, and sailed for the Faroes and Iceland with her
  retinue and possessions, marrying off two grand-daughters on the
  way, one, called Groa, to Duncan, Maormor of Duncansby in
  Caithness, the most ancient Pictish chief of whom we hear in that
  district, and probably ancestor of the Moldan, or Moddan, line in
  Cat. Two years later, in 877, King Constantine was defeated by a
  force of Danes at Dollar, and slain by them at Forgan in
  Fife.<a id="footnotetag33" name="footnotetag33"></a><a href=
  "#footnote33"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

  <p>After the great decisive battle of Hafrsfjord in Norway in
  872, because Orkney and Shetland and the Hebrides had become
  refuges for the Norse Vikings, who had been expelled from their
  country or had left it on the introduction of feudalism with its
  payment of dues to the king, but were raiding its shores, Harald
  Harfagr,<a id="footnotetag34" name="footnotetag34"></a><a href=
  "#footnote34"><sup>6</sup></a> king of Norway, along with Jarl
  Ragnvald of Maeri attacked and extirpated the pirate Vikings in
  their island lairs; and, as compensation to the jarl for the loss
  of his son Ivar in battle, Harald transferred his conquests with
  the title of Jarl of Orkney and Shetland to Ragnvald, who, in his
  turn, with the king's consent, soon made over his new territories
  and title to his brother Sigurd.</p>

  <p>This new jarl, the second founder of the line of Orkney jarls,
  conquered Caithness and Sutherland as far south as
  Ekkjals-bakki,<a id="footnotetag35" name=
  "footnotetag35"></a><a href="#footnote35"><sup>7</sup></a> which
  is believed by some <span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id=
  "page21"></a>[pg 21]</span> to be in Moray, and by others, with
  more truth, to be the ranges of hills in Sutherland and Ross
  lying to the north and to the south of the River Oykel and its
  estuary, the Dornoch Firth; and the second part of the name still
  happens to survive in the place-name of Backies in Dunrobin Glen
  and elsewhere in Cat where the Norse settled. About the year
  890,<a id="footnotetag36" name="footnotetag36"></a><a href=
  "#footnote36"><sup>8</sup></a> after challenging Malbrigde of the
  Buck-tooth to a fight with forty a side, to which he himself
  perfidiously brought eighty men, Sigurd outflanked and defeated
  his adversary, and cut off his head and suspended it from his
  saddle; but the buck-tooth, by chafing his leg as he rode away
  from the field, caused inflammation and death, and Jarl Sigurd's
  body was laid in howe on Oykel's Bank at Sigurthar-haugr, or
  Sigurds-haugr, the Siwards-hoch of early charters now on modern
  maps corruptly written Sidera or Cyderhall, near Dornoch, which,
  when translated, is Sigurd's Howe.<a id="footnotetag37" name=
  "footnotetag37"></a><a href="#footnote37"><sup>9</sup></a>
  "Thenceforward," as Professor Hume Brown tells us, "the mainland
  was never secure from the attacks of successive jarls, who for
  long periods held firm possession of what is now Caithness and
  Sutherland. As things now went, this was in truth in the interest
  of the kings of Scots themselves. To the north of the Grampians
  they exercised little or no authority; and the people of that
  district were as often their enemies as their friends. Through
  the action of the Orkney jarls, therefore, the Scottish kings
  were at comparative liberty to extend their territory towards the
  south; and the day came when they found themselves able to crush
  every hostile element even in the north.<a id="footnotetag38"
  name="footnotetag38"></a><a href=
  "#footnote38"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

  <p>It is this process of consolidation in the north which it is
  proposed to describe so far as Sutherland and Caithness are
  concerned, using both Norse and Scottish records, and piecing
  them together as best we can, and, be it confessed, in many cases
  filling up great gaps by necessary guess-work when records
  fail.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id=
  "page22"></a>[pg 22]</span>

  <p>In the reign of the great king Constantine III, between the
  years 900 and 942, the Danes again gave trouble. In 903 the Irish
  Danes ravaged Alban,<a id="footnotetag39" name=
  "footnotetag39"></a><a href="#footnote39"><sup>11</sup></a> as
  Scotland north of the Forth was then called, for a whole year; in
  918 Constantine and his ally, Eldred of Lothian, were defeated by
  another expedition of these invaders; and in 934 Athelstan and
  his Saxons burst into Strathclyde and Forfar, the heart of
  Constantine's kingdom, and the Saxon fleet was sent up even to
  the shores of Caithness, as a naval demonstration intended to
  brave the Norse, who had joined Constantine, on their own
  element. Lastly, in 937 Athelstan and Constantine met at
  Brunanburg, probably Birrenswark near Ecclefechan, and
  Constantine and his Norse allies were completely defeated.<a id=
  "footnotetag40" name="footnotetag40"></a><a href=
  "#footnote40"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

  <p>Meantime, since 875, a succession of jarls had endeavoured to
  hold, for the kings of Norway, Orkney and Shetland, as well as
  Cat, which then included Ness, Strathnavern, and Sudrland.<a id=
  "footnotetag41" name="footnotetag41"></a><a href=
  "#footnote41"><sup>13</sup></a> The history of these early jarls
  is not told in detail in any surviving contemporary record, for
  the Sagas of the jarls as individuals have perished; but there is
  a brief account of them in the beginning of the <i>Orkneyinga
  Saga</i>, another in chapters 99 and 100 of the <i>St. Olaf's
  Saga</i>, and a fuller one in chapters 179 to 187 of the <i>Saga
  of Olaf Tryggvi's Son</i>, contained in the <i>Flatey
  Book</i>.<a id="footnotetag42" name="footnotetag42"></a><a href=
  "#footnote42"><sup>14</sup></a> From these the following story
  may be gathered.</p>

  <p>After Jarl Sigurd's death, his son Guthorm ruled for one
  winter, and died without issue, so that Sigurd's line came to an
  end. When Jarl Ragnvald of Maeri heard of his nephew's death, he
  sent his son Hallad over from Norway to Hrossey, as the mainland
  of Orkney was then called, and King Harald gave him the title of
  jarl. Failing in his efforts to put down the piracy of the
  Vikings, who continued their slayings and plunderings, Hallad,
  the last of the purely Norse jarls, resigned his jarldom, and
  returned ignominiously <span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id=
  "page23"></a>[pg 23]</span> to Norway. In the absence at war of
  Hrolf the Ganger, who became Duke of Normandy and was an ancestor
  of the kings of England, two others of Ragnvald's sons, Thorir
  and Hrollaug, were summoned to meet their father. At this meeting
  it was decided that neither of these should go to Orkney,
  Thorir's prospects in Norway being good, and Hrollaug's future
  lying in Iceland, where, it was said, he was to found a great
  family. Then Einar, the Jarl's youngest son by a thrall or slave
  woman, and thus not of pure Norse lineage, asked whether he might
  go, offering as an inducement to his father that, if he went, he
  would thus never be seen by him again. He was told that the
  sooner he went, and the longer he stayed away, the better his
  father would be pleased. A galley, well equipped, was given to
  him, and about the year 891 King Harald Harfagr conferred on him
  the title of Jarl of Orkney and Shetland, for which he sailed. On
  his arrival there, he attacked Kalf Skurfa and Thorir
  Treskegg,<a id="footnotetag43" name="footnotetag43"></a><a href=
  "#footnote43"><sup>15</sup></a> the pirate Viking leaders, and
  defeated and slew them both. He then took possession of the lands
  of the jarldom; and, from having taught the people of Turfness in
  Moray the use of turf or peat for fuel, was known thenceforward
  as Torf-Einar. He is said to have been "a tall man, ugly, with
  one eye, but very keen-sighted,"<a id="footnotetag44" name=
  "footnotetag44"></a><a href="#footnote44"><sup>16</sup></a> a
  faculty which he was soon to use.</p>

  <p>When Jarl Ragnvald of Maeri, the first of the Orkney jarls,
  was killed in Norway by two of Harald Harfagr's sons, one of
  them, Halfdan Halegg or Long-shanks fled from their father's
  vengeance to Orkney. When Halfdan landed, Torf-Einar took refuge
  in Scotland, but returned in force, and after defeating
  Halfdan&mdash;who had usurped the jarldom&mdash;in North
  Ronaldsay Firth, spied him as a fugitive, in hiding, far off on
  Rinarsey or Rinansey (Ninian's Island) now North Ronaldsay, and
  seized him, cut a blood-eagle <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page24" id="page24"></a>[pg 24]</span> on his back, severed his
  ribs and pulled out his lungs, and, after offering him as a
  victim to Odin, buried his body there.<a id="footnotetag45" name=
  "footnotetag45"></a><a href="#footnote45"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

  <p>Incensed at the shameful slaughter of his son, Harald Harfagr
  came over from Norway about the year 900 to avenge him, but, as
  was then not unusual, accepted as a wergeld or atonement for his
  son's death a fine of sixty marks of gold, which it fell to the
  islanders to pay. On their failure to find the money, Torf-Einar
  paid it himself, taking in return from the people their odal
  lands,<a id="footnotetag46" name="footnotetag46"></a><a href=
  "#footnote46"><sup>18</sup></a> which were lost to their families
  until Jarl Sigurd Hlodverson temporarily restored them as a
  recompense for their assistance in the battle fought by him
  between 969 and 995 against Finleac MacRuari, Maormor of North
  Moray, at Skidamyre in Caithness. Whether it was the Orkney jarls
  or their superiors, the kings of Norway, who owned them in the
  meantime, the odal lands were finally sold back to those entitled
  to them by descent by Jarl Ragnvald Kol's son about 1137, in
  order to raise money for the completion of Kirkwall Cathedral.
  Odal tenure in Orkney was thus in abeyance for over two
  centuries, save for a short time, and in any case its inherent
  principle of subdivision would have killed it, and after its
  renewal, in spite of its many safeguards against alienation to
  strangers, it gradually died out under feudalism and Scottish law
  and lawyers.<a id="footnotetag47" name=
  "footnotetag47"></a><a href="#footnote47"><sup>19</sup></a> In
  Cat it never seems to have taken root.</p>

  <p>After holding the jarldom for a long term, Torf-Einar died in
  his bed, as the Saga contemptuously tells us, probably in or
  after the year 920, leaving three sons, Arnkell, Erlend, and
  Thorfinn Hausa-kliufr or Skull-splitter, of whom the two first,
  Arnkell and Erlend, fell with Eric Bloody-axe, king of Norway, in
  England. The third son, Thorfinn Hausa-kliufr or Skull-splitter,
  himself about three-quarters Norse by blood, married Grelaud,
  daughter of Dungadr, or <span class="pagenum"><a name="page25"
  id="page25"></a>[pg 25]</span> Duncan, the Gaelic Maormor of
  Caithness by Groa, daughter of Thorfinn the Red, thus further
  Gaelicising the strain of the Norse Jarls of Orkney,<a id=
  "footnotetag48" name="footnotetag48"></a><a href=
  "#footnote48"><sup>20</sup></a> but adding greatly to their
  mainland territories.</p>

  <p>Jarl Thorfinn Hausa-kliufr, who flourished between 920 and
  963, is described as a great chief and fighter; but he, like his
  father, died a peaceful death, and was buried at Hoxa,
  Haugs-eithi or Mound's-isthmus, which covers the site of a
  Pictish broch, near the north-west end of South Ronaldshay.<a id=
  "footnotetag49" name="footnotetag49"></a><a href=
  "#footnote49"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

  <p>When Eric Bloody-axe had been defeated and killed, his sons
  came to Orkney and seized the jarldom, and his widow, the
  notoriously wicked Gunnhild and her daughter Ragnhild settled
  there for a time. Thorfinn Hausa-kliufr had five sons, Arnfinn,
  Havard, Hlodver, Ljotr and Skuli. Three of these, Arnfinn. Havard
  and Ljotr, successively married Ragnhild, and Ragnhild rivalled
  her mother in wickedness. Arnfinn she killed at Murkle in
  Caithness with her own hand; Havard she induced Einar
  Oily-tongue, his nephew, to slay, on her promise to marry him,
  which she broke; and finally she married Jarl Ljotr instead.
  Skuli, the only other surviving son save Hlodver, went to the
  king of Scots, who is said to have lightly given away what did
  not belong to him, and to have created him Earl of Caithness,
  which then included Sudrland.<a id="footnotetag50" name=
  "footnotetag50"></a><a href="#footnote50"><sup>22</sup></a> Skuli
  then raised a force in his new earldom, no doubt to carry out
  Scottish policy, and, crossing to Orkney, fought a battle there
  with his brother Ljotr, was defeated, and fled to Caithness.
  Collecting another army in Scotland, Skuli fought a second battle
  at Dalar or Dalr, probably Dale in the upper valley of the Thurso
  River in Caithness, and was there defeated and killed by Ljotr,
  who took possession of his dominions. Then followed a battle
  between Ljotr and a Scottish earl called Magbiod or Macbeth, at
  Skida Myre or Skitten Moor in Watten in Caithness, which
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg
  26]</span> Ljotr won, but died of his wounds shortly after, and
  is said to have been buried at Stenhouse in Watten.<a id=
  "footnotetag51" name="footnotetag51"></a><a href=
  "#footnote51"><sup>23</sup></a> Thus the first Scottish attempt
  at consolidation of the north failed.</p>

  <p>During the last half of the tenth century there was constant
  war by the kings of Alban against the Northmen who had seized the
  coast of Moray, and Malcolm I was killed at Ulern near Kinloss,
  about the year 954, and his successor Indulf fell in the hour of
  his victory over the invaders at Cullen in Banff.<a id=
  "footnotetag52" name="footnotetag52"></a><a href=
  "#footnote52"><sup>24</sup></a> But on the whole probably the
  Scots had succeeded for a time in driving out the Norse from the
  laigh of Moray, which the latter needed for its supplies of
  grain.</p>

  <p>Hlodver or Lewis, (963-980), the only surviving son of
  Thorfinn Hausa-kliufr, succeeded Ljotr in the jarldom; and by
  Audna or Edna, daughter of Kiarval, king of the Hy Ivar of Dublin
  and Limerick, Hlodver had a son, the famous Sigurd the Stout, or
  Sigurd Hlodverson. Hlodver was, (as Mr. A.W. Johnston points
  out),<a id="footnotetag53" name="footnotetag53"></a><a href=
  "#footnote53"><sup>25</sup></a> by blood slightly more Norse than
  Gaelic. We know little of him save that he was a mighty chief;
  and, according to the usual reproach of the Saga, died in his bed
  and not in battle about 980, and was buried at Hofn, probably
  Huna, in Caithness, near John o' Groats, under a howe.<a id=
  "footnotetag54" name="footnotetag54"></a><a href=
  "#footnote54"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

  <p>The line of the so-called Norse earls, at the period at which
  we have arrived, 980 A.D., was represented by Sigurd Hlodverson,
  the hero of the Raven banner, which, as his Irish mother had
  predicted, was to bring victory to every host which followed it,
  but death to every man who bore it in battle.<a id=
  "footnotetag55" name="footnotetag55"></a><a href=
  "#footnote55"><sup>27</sup></a> Sigurd claimed Caithness by the
  rules of Pictish succession, as grandson of Grelaud daughter of
  Duncan of Duncansby, Maormor of that district. This claim was
  disputed by two Celtic chiefs, Hundi (possibly Crinan, Abthane of
  Dunkeld) and Melsnati, or Maelsnechtan; and in a battle at
  Dungal's Noep, near Duncansby, at which <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg 27]</span> Kari
  Solmundarson is said in the <i>Saga of Burnt Njal</i><a id=
  "footnotetag56" name="footnotetag56"></a><a href=
  "#footnote56"><sup>28</sup></a> to have been present, Sigurd
  defeated them, but with such loss to his own side that he had to
  retire to Orkney, leaving Hundi,<a id="footnotetag57" name=
  "footnotetag57"></a><a href="#footnote57"><sup>29</sup></a> the
  survivor of his two enemies, in possession of his lands in
  Caithness. Sigurd himself, on his voyage from Orkney, fell into
  the hands of the Norse king, Olaf Tryggvi's-son, who was
  returning from Dublin to Norway, in the bay of Osmundwall or Kirk
  Hope in Walls; and the king insisted on the jarl being baptized
  on the spot, under penalty, if he and all the inhabitants of his
  jarldom did not become and remain Christians, of losing his
  eldest son Hundi or Hvelpr, whom the Norse king seized and
  retained as a hostage. He also sent missionaries to evangelize
  the jarldom. Such was the conversion of Orkney and its jarl from
  the worship of Odin, at or about the end of the first millennium
  of the Christian era.</p>

  <p>On his son's death in captivity, Sigurd seems to have deserted
  the Norse for the Scottish side, and to have devoted himself to
  seeking the favour, by his assistance in completing the conquest
  of Moray from the Norse, of the Scottish king Malcolm II, whose
  third daughter he married as his second wife.<a id=
  "footnotetag58" name="footnotetag58"></a><a href=
  "#footnote58"><sup>30</sup></a> He was, by race, more than
  two-thirds Gaelic, and he clearly at first held Caithness in
  spite of all Scottish attacks, and probably later on agreed to
  hold it from the Scottish king.</p>

  <p>A few other persons are referred to in the Sagas as connected
  with Caithness at this time. In the Landnamabok (1.6.5) we find
  Swart Kell, or Cathal Dhu, mentioned as having gone from
  Caithness and taken land in settlement in Mydalr in Iceland, and
  his son was Thorkel, the father of Glum, who took Christendom
  when he was already old.</p>

  <p>About this time also, as appears from the <i>Saga of
  Thorgisl</i>,<a id="footnotetag59" name=
  "footnotetag59"></a><a href="#footnote59"><sup>31</sup></a> there
  was an Earl Anlaf or Olaf in Caithness, <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg 28]</span> who had
  a sister, named Gudrun, whom Swart Ironhead, a pirate, sought in
  marriage. But Swart was killed in holmgang, or duel, by Thorgisl,
  who cut off his head and married Gudrun, by whom he had a son
  called Thorlaf. Thorgisl then tired of Gudrun, and gave her to
  Thorstan the White on the plea that he himself wished to go and
  look after his estate in Iceland, which he did. Can this Anlaf be
  the original of the legendary Alane, thane of Sutherland, whom
  Macbeth, according to Sir Robert Gordon in his <i>Genealogie of
  the Earles of Southerland</i>,<a id="footnotetag60" name=
  "footnotetag60"></a><a href="#footnote60"><sup>32</sup></a> put
  to death, and whose son, Walter, Malcolm Canmore is said to have
  created first Earl? Or was Alane, like others, a creation of Sir
  Robert's inventive brain? He was certainly no earl of the present
  Sutherland line; neither was Walter.<a id="footnotetag61" name=
  "footnotetag61"></a><a href="#footnote61"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

  <p>To this period also belongs the romantic story of Barth or
  Bard, son of Helgi and Helga Ulfs-datter told in the <i>Flatey
  Book</i>, and translated at page 369 of the Appendix to Sir
  George Dasent's Rolls Edition of the <i>Orkneyinga Saga</i>,
  which is shortly as follows.</p>

  <p>In the time of Sigurd Hlodverson, Ulf the Bad, of Sanday in
  Orkney, murdered Harald of North Ronaldsay, and seized his lands
  in the absence of Harald's son Helgi, a gentle Viking, on a
  cruise. On his return, Helgi, to revenge his father's death, slew
  Bard, Ulf's next of kin, in fight. Jarl Sigurd blames him for
  this and for not letting him settle the feud himself, and Helgi
  sells all he has, and goes to Ulf's house and takes his daughter,
  Helga, away. Ulf follows them up by sea with a superior force,
  defeats Helgi off Caithness, and he jumps overboard with Helga
  and swims to shore, where a poor farmer, Thorfinn, as Helgi had
  always been kind in his "vikings" to such as he was, has the
  wedding at his house, and shelters the pair there till on Ulf's
  death two years after they can return to Orkney with Bard or
  Barth, their infant <span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id=
  "page29"></a>[pg 29]</span> son. At twelve years of age, Barth
  desires to fare away "to those peoples who believe in the God of
  Heaven Himself," and fares far away accordingly. Barth works for
  a farmer, and works so well that his flocks increase, and gets a
  cow for himself as a reward, but meets a beggar who begs the cow
  of him "for Peter's thanks." Each year a cow is the reward of
  Barth's work, and each year he is asked for the cow, and gives
  her up, until he has given three cows. Then St. Peter (for the
  beggar was no other than he) passes his hands over Barth, and
  gives him good luck, and sets a book upon his shoulders; and he
  saw far and wide over many lands, and over all Ireland, and he
  was baptized, and became a holy hermit and a bishop in Ireland.
  Such is the Norse story of Barth, to whom the first Cathedral in
  Dornoch was said to have been dedicated. It is far more prettily
  told in the Saga.</p>

  <p>But St. Barr of Dornoch, in all probability, belongs to the
  sixth century,<a id="footnotetag62" name=
  "footnotetag62"></a><a href="#footnote62"><sup>34</sup></a> not
  to the tenth, and was a Pict or Irishman, not a Norseman. He was
  never Bishop of Caithness, so far as records tell. His Fair, like
  those of other Pictish Saints elsewhere in Cat, is still
  celebrated, and is held at Dornoch.</p>

  <p>The battle of Clontarf, fought on Good Friday, the 23rd of
  April 1014, outside Dublin, between the young heathen king of
  Dublin, Sigtrigg Silkbeard, and the aged Christian king, Brian
  Borumha, was, notwithstanding Norse representations to the
  contrary, a decisive victory for the Irish over the Norse, and
  for Christianity against Odinism. Sigurd, Jarl of Orkney, though
  nominally a Christian, fought on the heathen side, and fell
  bearing his Raven banner, and the old king, Brian, was killed in
  the hour of his people's victory.</p>

  <p>Sigurd's death is the subject of a strange legend, and the
  occasion of a weird poem, <i>The Darratha-Liod</i><a id=
  "footnotetag63" name="footnotetag63"></a><a href=
  "#footnote63"><sup>35</sup></a> said to have been sung in
  Caithness for the first time on the day of Sigurd's
  death.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id=
  "page30"></a>[pg 30]</span>

  <p>The legend is given in the <i>Niala</i><a id="footnotetag64"
  name="footnotetag64"></a><a href="#footnote64"><sup>36</sup></a>
  as follows:&mdash;"On Friday it happened in Caithness that a man
  called Dorruthr went out of his house and saw that twelve men
  together rode to a certain bower, where they all disappeared. He
  went to the bower, and looked in through a window, and saw that
  within there were women, who had set up a web. They sang the
  poem, calling on the listener, Dorruthr, to learn the song, and
  to tell it to others. When the song was over, they tore down the
  web, each one retaining what she held in her hand of it. And now
  Dorruthr went away from the window and returned home, while they
  mounted their horses, riding six to the north and six to the
  south. A similar vision appeared to Brand, the son of Gneisti, in
  the Faroes. At Swinefell in Iceland blood fell on the cope of a
  priest on Good Friday, so that he had to take it off. At Thvatta
  a priest saw on Good Friday deep sea before the altar and many
  terrible wonders therein, and for long he was unable to sing the
  Hours."<a id="footnotetag65" name="footnotetag65"></a><a href=
  "#footnote65"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

  <p>This strange legend of early telepathy may be explained by the
  fact that Thorstein, son of the Icelander Hall o' Side, fought
  for Sigurd at Clontarf, and afterwards returned to Iceland and
  told the story of the battle, which the Saga preserved; and the
  English poet, Thomas Gray, used it as the theme of his well-known
  poem intituled <i>The Fatal Sisters</i>. The old Norse ballad
  referred to Sigurd's death at Clontarf in 1014. It is known as
  <i>Darratha-Liod</i> or <i>The Javelin-Song</i>, and is
  translated by the late Eirikr Magnusson and printed in the
  <i>Miscellany of the Viking Society</i> with the Old Norse
  original<a id="footnotetag66" name="footnotetag66"></a><a href=
  "#footnote66"><sup>38</sup></a> and the translator's scholarly
  notes and explanations. It is said that it was often sung in Old
  Norse in North Ronaldsay until the middle of the eighteenth
  century.</p>

  <p>The nine centuries, above referred to, of Roman invasion,
  intestine war, and ecclesiastical rivalry between the Pictish,
  Columban and Catholic Churches had now, under Malcolm II,
  produced a kingdom of Scotland, throughout which the Catholic was
  in a fair way to become the predominant Church, and in which the
  authority of the Scottish Crown was for the time being,
  nominally, but in the north merely nominally, supreme on the
  mainland from the Tweed to the Pentland Firth. The Isles of
  Orkney and Shetland and the whole of the Sudreyar or Hebrides,
  however, owed allegiance, whether their jarls admitted it or not,
  to the Crown of Norway, and the Scottish kings had no authority
  over them.<a id="footnotetag68" name="footnotetag68"></a><a href=
  "#footnote68"><sup>40</sup></a> Moreover, the
  Northmen&mdash;Danes and Norsemen and Gallgaels&mdash;held the
  western seas from the Butt of Lewis to the Isle of Man, and they
  had severed the connection between the Scots of Ulster and the
  Scots of Argyll. The latter had thus been forced to move
  eastwards, in order to avoid constant raids by the Irish Danes
  and Norsemen and the Gallgaels, who thus possessed themselves of
  all the coast of Scotland then known as Airergaithel or Argyll,
  which extended up to Ross and Assynt, west of the Drumalban
  watershed.</p>

  <p>Of the next nine centuries from 1000 to the present time it is
  proposed to deal with the first two hundred and seventy years
  only, which, with the preceding <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page34" id="page34"></a>[pg 34]</span> century and a half, form
  a chapter of Scottish history complete in itself. The narrative,
  as already stated, will be based largely upon the great Stories
  or Tales known as the <i>Orkneyinga, St. Magnus'</i>, and
  <i>Hakonar Sagas</i>, and also upon Scottish and English
  chronicles and records so far as they throw their fitful light
  upon the northern counties of Scotland, and especially upon
  Caithness and Sutherland, during the dark periods between these
  Sagas.</p>

  <p>Attention will have to be paid to the Pictish family of Moldan
  of Duncansby, of Moddan, created Earl of Caithness by his uncle
  Duncan I, and of Moddan "in Dale," each of whom in turn succeeded
  to much of the estates of the ancient Maormors of Duncansby, but
  whose people had been driven back from most of the best low-lying
  lands into the upper valleys and the hills by the foreign
  invaders of Cat. For, when the Norse Vikings first attacked Cat
  and succeeded in conquering the Picts there, they conquered by no
  means the whole of that province. They subdued and held only that
  part of Ness or modern Caithness which lies next its north and
  east coasts, and the rest of the sea-board of Ness, Strathnavern
  and Sudrland, forcing their way up the lower parts of the valleys
  of these districts, as their place-names still live on to prove;
  but they never conquered, so as to occupy and hold them, the
  upper parts of these river basins or the hills above them, which
  remained in possession of Picts and Gaels throughout the whole
  period of the Norse occupation. Further, the Picts and Gaels
  extended the area which they retained, until Norse rule was
  expelled from the mainland altogether.</p>

  <p>In Strathnavern and in the upper valleys of its rivers, and
  also in Caithness in the uplands of the river Thurso, and in a
  large part of Sudrland the Pictish family and clan of Moddan in
  its various branches subsisted all through the Norse occupation,
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg
  35]</span> and it is hoped to show good reason for believing that
  the family of Moddan, with the Pictish or Scottish family of
  Freskyn de Moravia in later times, was the mainstay of Scottish
  rule in the extreme north until the shadowy claims of Norse
  suzerains over every part of the mainland were completely
  repelled, and avowedly abandoned.</p>

  <p>Meantime to Norway Orkney and Cat were essential. For their
  fertile lands yielded the supplies of grain which Norway
  required; and when the Norse were driven from the arable lands of
  the Moray seaboard, Orkney and Cat became still more necessary to
  them and their folk at home. Cat the Scots could not then reach,
  for the Norse held the sea, while on land Pictish Moray, a
  jealous power, hostile to its southern neighbours, lay in its
  mountain fastnesses between the territory of the Scots in the
  south and the land of Cat in the extreme north, and formed a
  barrier which stretched across Alban from the North Sea to the
  shores of Assynt on the Skotlands-fiorthr or
  Minch.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id=

  <h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

  <h3>Thorfinn&mdash;Earl and Jarl.</h3>

  <p>Malcolm II, with whom Scottish contemporary records may be
  said to begin, ascended the Scottish throne in 1005, and defeated
  the Norse at Mortlach in Moray in 1010, and drove them from its
  fertile seaboard, probably with the help of Sigurd Hlodverson,
  Jarl of Orkney. The men of Moray, however, and their Pictish
  Maormors remained ungrateful, and irreconcilably opposed to
  Scottish rule; and Moray, then stretching across almost from
  ocean to ocean,<a id="footnotetag69" name=
  "footnotetag69"></a><a href="#footnote69"><sup>1</sup></a> barred
  the way of the Scots to the north.</p>

  <p>What he could not achieve by arms, Malcolm, both before and
  after his accession, decided to secure by a series of matrimonial
  alliances. He had no son; but he had three available
  daughters,<a id="footnotetag70" name="footnotetag70"></a><a href=
  "#footnote70"><sup>2</sup></a> of whom the eldest was Bethoc, and
  the two others are said to have been called Donada or Doada and
  Plantula.</p>

  <p>1. <i>Bethoc</i> he married to the most powerful Pictish
  leader of the time, Crinan, Abthane of Dunkeld, the capital of
  the southern Picts, and they had issue</p>

  <p>(a) <i>Duncan</i>, afterwards Duncan I of Scotland, born about
  1001;</p>

  <p>(b) <i>Maldred</i> of Cumbria, whose eldest son was
  Gospatrick, and whose second son was Dolfin; but with Maldred we
  are not concerned;</p>

  <p>(c) <i>A daughter</i>, who became the mother of Moddan, whom
  Duncan I, after his accession in 1034, created Earl of Caithness
  or Cat, probably about 1040, his father being possibly of the
  family of Moldan of Duncansby, whose sons Gritgard and Snaekolf,
  if we may believe the <i>Njal Saga</i>, were slain by Helgi
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg
  37]</span> Njal's son and Kari Solmundarson, Moldan being said to
  be a kinsman of Malcolm the Scots king.</p>

  <p>2. Malcolm's second daughter, <i>Donada</i>, he married to
  Finnleac or Finlay Mac Ruari, Maormor of North Moray, and a chief
  of the northern Picts, and they had a son, Macbeth, born about
  1005, who succeeded Duncan I on his death in 1040 as King of
  Scotland, but left no issue.<a id="footnotetag71" name=
  "footnotetag71"></a><a href="#footnote71"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

  <p>3. Malcolm's third daughter, said to have been called
  <i>Plantula</i>, he gave, about 1007, as his second wife to
  Sigurd Hlodverson, who, as we have seen, was killed in 1014 at
  the decisive battle of Clontarf, his wife having died probably
  before that event; and their only child was a son, born about
  1008 and created Earl of Caithness and Sutherland, who became the
  great Earl and Jarl <i>Thorfinn</i>.</p>

  <p>The three marriages were intended to secure to Malcolm the
  south, the middle, and the north of Pictland through the fathers
  of Duncan, Macbeth, and Thorfinn respectively; and we may note
  that from Thorfinn are descended all subsequent Jarls and Earls
  of Orkney and Shetland and Caithness of the so-called Norse
  line.</p>

  <p>Duncan I, Macbeth, and Thorfinn Sigurd's son were thus first
  cousins, and, in spite of the fiction of Holinshed, Boece, and
  William Shakespeare, they were all about the same age, being born
  within seven years of each other; and none of them lived to old
  age.</p>

  <p>By the victory of Carham in 1018 Malcolm II secured for ever
  the line of the Tweed as Scotland's southern frontier; and this
  success in the south, one of the most important events in
  Scottish history, left him free to extend his kingdom and
  sovereignty towards the north, his object being to unite into one
  realm the whole mainland at least of Scotland. To accomplish
  this, he would have to bring under the supremacy of the
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg
  38]</span> Scottish crown in addition to the Picts of Atholl,
  whom the Scots had absorbed, the Gallgaels of Argyll, the Picts
  of Moray and of Ross within and beyond the Grampians, and those
  of the province of Cat, with the Norsemen there as well. He could
  thus ultimately hope to oust Somarled, Brusi and Einar, Jarl
  Sigurd's sons by his first wife, and their overlords, the Norse
  kings, from Orkney and Shetland, and to add those islands to his
  dominions. Meantime, Somarled, Brusi and Einar took no share in
  Cat. Thorfinn had Cat, all for himself, as a fief of the Scottish
  king.</p>

  <p>Although the history of the time of Thorfinn Sigurdson, the
  first Scottish Earl of Caithness and Sutherland,<a id=
  "footnotetag72" name="footnotetag72"></a><a href=
  "#footnote72"><sup>4</sup></a> would have been of great interest
  to inhabitants of those counties, the <i>Orkneyinga Saga</i>
  contains but little information about his doings in them, because
  he bent all his efforts towards extending his dominion over the
  islands which formed his father Sigurd's jarldom, his policy, in
  his youth at least, being directed to this object by his
  grandfather, Malcolm II. Indeed during the life of that king,
  Thorfinn appears to have established himself at Duncansby in
  Caithness, on the shore of the Pentland Firth, and to have
  occupied himself in endeavouring to induce his three surviving
  half-brothers, Somarled, Brusi, and Einar, to part with as large
  a share as possible of Orkney and Shetland, and cede it to
  himself. In this he had much assistance from King Malcolm.
  Thorfinn, whose mother probably died in his infancy if we are to
  credit his father's matrimonial stipulations as regards an Irish
  wife in 1014, succeeded to the earldom and lands in that year, as
  a boy of about six years of age, and was early in coming to his
  full growth, the "tallest and strongest of men; his hair was
  black, his features sharp, his brows scowling, and, as soon as he
  grew up, it was easy to see that he was forward and grasping."
  From the description given <span class="pagenum"><a name="page39"
  id="page39"></a>[pg 39]</span> in the Saga at Chapter 22, he was
  no more a Norseman in appearance than he was by blood. He was, in
  fact, by race and descent, almost a pure Gael, and at Malcolm's
  court must have spoken only Gaelic.</p>

  <p>Of his three half-brothers, Somarled and Brusi were not
  unwilling to give Thorfinn a share of the Orkney jarldom. For
  they were meek men, especially Brusi; and, when Somarled died,
  though Einar wanted two shares for himself, and fought to retain
  them, he only wearied out his followers and alienated them by his
  cruelty. They, therefore, went over to Thorfinn in Caithness.
  More important still, Thorkel Amundson, "the properest young man
  in Orkney," did likewise, and was thenceforward known as Thorkel
  Fostri, foster-father to Thorfinn, whom he aided at every crisis
  of his career.</p>

  <p>When Thorfinn grew up, he claimed a third share of Orkney,
  and, not getting it, "called out a force from Caithness" where he
  mostly lived.<a id="footnotetag73" name=
  "footnotetag73"></a><a href="#footnote73"><sup>5</sup></a> Brusi
  and Einar then pooled their share of the islands, Einar having
  the control of both; and Thorfinn got his trithing,<a id=
  "footnotetag74" name="footnotetag74"></a><a href=
  "#footnote74"><sup>6</sup></a> managing it by his men, who
  collected his scatt and tolls under Thorkel Fostri, whom Einar
  plotted to kill. Einar next seized Eyvind Urarhorn, a Norse
  subject of distinction, who had caused his complete defeat in
  Ulfreksfirth in Ireland, but was sheltering from a storm in
  Orkney, and killed him, to the great anger of the Norse king.</p>

  <p>Grasping at once the opportunity thus created, Thorfinn
  determined to turn it to his own advantage. He sent Thorkel to
  King Olaf in Norway to seek protection for himself against Einar,
  and Thorkel came back bearing an invitation to Thorfinn to visit
  the Norwegian court, from which the jarl returned as much in
  favour with the king as Einar was in disgrace. Brusi then tried
  to reconcile Thorfinn and Einar, and Thorkel was to be included
  in the settlement. Thorkel, however, <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg 40]</span> after
  inviting Einar to a feast in his hall at Sandvik in Deerness, a
  promontory south-east of Kirkwall, discovered a plot by Einar to
  attack him by three several ambushes as they left the house. In a
  striking scene, the Saga tells how Thorkel, wounded, and Halvard,
  an Icelander, dispatched Einar at the hearth of the hall; how
  Einar's followers did not interfere; and how Thorkel fled to King
  Olaf in Norway, who was much gratified by the death of Einar, the
  slayer of his own friend Eyvind Urarhorn.<a id="footnotetag75"
  name="footnotetag75"></a><a href=
  "#footnote75"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

  <p>On Einar's death, Brusi tried to get two-thirds of the isles,
  but Thorfinn now claimed a half share, and King Olaf, in spite of
  a visit by Thorfinn to him in Norway, ultimately awarded Brusi
  two-thirds, Thorfinn having the rest. Brusi, however, being
  unable to defend the isles from pirates, about the year 1028 gave
  up one of his trithings to Thorfinn on his undertaking the
  defence of the isles,<a id="footnotetag76" name=
  "footnotetag76"></a><a href="#footnote76"><sup>8</sup></a> for
  which a powerful fleet would be essential, and Brusi died in
  1031.</p>

  <p>After this settlement of their claims, Malcolm II died in 1034
  at the age of eighty; and his death wrecked his policy. For
  Duncan, his grandson, the Karl Hundason of the Saga, on his
  accession to the Scottish throne claimed tribute from his cousin
  Thorfinn for Caithness. Payment was at once refused, and six
  years of strife, interrupted by Duncan's unfortunate raids south
  of the Tweed, ended by his creating Mumtan or Moddan, his own
  sister's son, Earl of Caithness instead of Thorfinn. With a force
  collected in Sudrland, which thus appears to have been on the
  Scottish side, Moddan tried to make good his title, but Thorfinn
  raised an army in Caithness, and Thorkel collected another for
  him in Orkney, and the Scots retired before superior numbers.
  "Then Earl Thorfinn fared after them, and laid under him Sudrland
  and Ross and harried far and wide over Scotland; thence he turned
  back to Caithness," and "sate at Duncansby, and had <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg 41]</span> there
  five long-ships ... and just enough force to man them
  well."<a id="footnotetag77" name="footnotetag77"></a><a href=
  "#footnote77"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

  <p>After his retirement in Caithness, Moddan went to Duncan at
  North Berwick, and Duncan sent him back with another force by
  land to Caithness, proceeding thither himself by sea with eleven
  ships. Duncan caught Thorfinn and his five ships off the Mull of
  Deerness in the Mainland of Orkney, where, after a stiff
  hand-to-hand fight, the Scots fleet was defeated and chased
  southwards by Thorfinn to Moray, which he ravaged.<a id=
  "footnotetag78" name="footnotetag78"></a><a href=
  "#footnote78"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

  <p>Finding that Moddan and his army were in Thurso, Thorfinn sent
  Thorkel Fostri thither secretly with part of his forces, and he
  set fire to the house in which Moddan was, and killed him there
  as he tried to escape. Thorkel next raised levies in Caithness,
  Sutherland, and Ross, joined forces with Thorfinn in Moray, and
  harried the land, whereupon Duncan collected an army from the
  south of Scotland and Cantire and Ireland, and attacked his
  enemies in the north.</p>

  <p>A great battle ensued near the Norse stronghold of
  Turfness,<a id="footnotetag79" name="footnotetag79"></a><a href=
  "#footnote79"><sup>11</sup></a> probably Burghead, where peat is
  found in abundance, though now submerged; and the battle was
  fought at Standing Stane in the parish of Duffus, three miles and
  a half E.S.E. of Burghead, on the 14th of August 1040.</p>

  <p>The Saga gives the following description of the jarl and of
  the fighting:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Earl Thorfinn was at the head of his battle array; he had a
  gilded helmet on his head, and was girt with a sword, a great
  spear in his hand, and he fought with it, striking right and
  left.... He went thither first where the battle of those Irish
  was; so hot was he with his train, that they gave way at once
  before him, and never afterwards got into good order again. Then
  Karl let them bring forward his banner to meet Thorfinn; there
  was a hard fight, and the end of it was <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg 42]</span> that
  Karl laid himself out to fly, but some men say that he has
  fallen."</p>

  <p>"Earl Thorfinn drove the flight before him a long way up into
  Scotland, and after that he fared about far and wide over the
  land and laid it under him."<a id="footnotetag80" name=
  "footnotetag80"></a><a href="#footnote80"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

  <p>Then followed Thorfinn's conquests in Fife, and after relating
  the failure of a Scottish force, which had surrendered, to kill
  him by surprise, the Saga gives a lurid picture of his burnings
  of farms and slayings of all the fighting men, "while the women
  and old men dragged themselves off to the woods and wastes with
  weeping and wailing," and it also tells of his journey north
  along Scotland to his ships.<a id="footnotetag81" name=
  "footnotetag81"></a><a href="#footnote81"><sup>13</sup></a> "He
  fared then north to Caithness, and sate there that winter, but
  every summer thenceforth he had his levies out, and harried about
  the west lands, but sate most often still in the winters,"
  feasting his men at his own expense, especially at Yuletide, in
  true Viking style.</p>

  <p>Allowing for exaggeration, it is not too much to say that
  Thorfinn and his cousin Macbeth must, after the death of their
  cousin Duncan in 1040, between them have held all that is now
  Scotland save the Lothians, until about 1057, when Macbeth was
  slain. To us it is interesting to note<a id="footnotetag82" name=
  "footnotetag82"></a><a href="#footnote82"><sup>14</sup></a> that
  Duncan died, not in old age, (as Shakespeare, following Boece and
  the English chronicler Holinshed would have us believe) but a
  young man of thirty-nine years, either in, or after, Thorfinn's
  battle, and that he fell a victim not of Groa, Macbeth's wife's
  cup of poison, but possibly of her husband's dagger at
  Bothgowanan or Pitgavenny, a smithy about two miles from Elgin.
  We should also note that Thorfinn's cruelty made it difficult for
  him ever to hope to obtain and keep the throne of Scotland, which
  thus fell to Macbeth.</p>

  <p>Meantime Jarl Brusi had died about 1031, and though he left a
  son Ragnvald, this son was long abroad in Norway, where he was
  taught all the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id=
  "page43"></a>[pg 43]</span> accomplishments suitable to his rank,
  and remained there at the time of his father's death.<a id=
  "footnotetag83" name="footnotetag83"></a><a href=
  "#footnote83"><sup>15</sup></a> Ragnvald Brusi-son was "one of
  the handsomest of men, his hair long and yellow as silk, and he
  was stout and tall and an able splendid man of great mind and
  polite manners." He had saved King Olaf's brother Harald
  Sigurdson at the great battle of Stiklastad, after King Olaf,
  Ragnvald's own foster-father, was killed, and had fought with
  great distinction in Russia. Shortly after his father's death,
  Ragnvald returned, and, fortified by a grant from King Magnus of
  Norway, whom he had helped to gain the throne, claimed his
  father's two trithings of the Orkney jarldom. To this Thorfinn,
  who after 1034 had his hands full with his war with King Duncan,
  and had always wars with the Hebrides and the Irish, agreed, and
  the two joined forces, and sailed on Viking raids to the Hebrides
  and England.<a id="footnotetag84" name=
  "footnotetag84"></a><a href="#footnote84"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

  <p>About 1044 Thorfinn married Ingibjorg,<a id="footnotetag85"
  name="footnotetag85"></a><a href="#footnote85"><sup>17</sup></a>
  Finn Arnason's daughter, and it is interesting to find that in
  the <i>Saga Book of the Viking Club</i>, Vol. IV, page 171, Mr.
  Collingwood suggests that the King of Catanesse, who fought for
  years to gain possession of Gratiana, the lost wife of William
  the Wanderer, was Thorfinn. If this story be founded on fact, as
  it probably is, this may account for his somewhat late marriage
  with Ingibjorg.</p>

  <p>Thorfinn next claimed two trithings of Orkney from his nephew
  Ragnvald, who demurred to giving up what the Norse king had
  conferred on him, but, finding he could not cope with Thorfinn's
  Orkney, Caithness and Scottish forces, Ragnvald fled to King
  Magnus, who gave him a force of picked men, and bade Kalf Arnason
  also to help him, although Kalf was Thorfinn's friend, and near
  connection by marriage.</p>

  <p>The two jarls met in battle in the Pentland Firth, off
  Rautharbiorg or Rattar Brough in Caithness, east of Dunnet Head,
  Kalf Arnason with his six ships standing <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg 44]</span> out of
  the fight. Thorfinn had sixty ships, smaller, and, save
  Thorfinn's own, lower in the waist than those of his enemy, who
  thus easily boarded them, and then attacked Thorfinn. Surrounded
  and boarded on both sides, Thorfinn cut his ship free and rowed
  to land. Arrived there, he removed his seventy dead, and all his
  wounded. Next he persuaded Kalf Arnason to join him with his six
  ships, and renewed and won the fight, though Ragnvald himself
  escaped to Norway.<a id="footnotetag86" name=
  "footnotetag86"></a><a href="#footnote86"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

  <p>Sailing thence in 1046 with one ship and a picked crew,
  Ragnvald surrounded Thorfinn,<a id="footnotetag87" name=
  "footnotetag87"></a><a href="#footnote87"><sup>19</sup></a> who
  was wintering in Mainland of Orkney, and set fire to the Hall at
  Orphir in which he was, but the earl tore out a panel at the
  back, and, escaping through it with his young wife Ingibjorg in
  his arms, rowed in the dark over to Caithness, where he remained
  in hiding among his friends, all in Orkney believing him dead.
  Ragnvald then seized all the islands, and lived at Kirkwall.</p>

  <p>But, while Ragnvald was in Little Papey&mdash;now Papa
  Stronsay&mdash;to fetch malt for Yuletide, Thorfinn returned, and
  surrounded the house in which Ragnvald was, by night; and, on his
  escaping by leaping through the besiegers in priestly disguise,
  Thorfinn's men followed him, and, led by his lapdog's barking,
  discovered him among the rocks by the sea, where Thorkel Fostri
  slew him, Thorfinn meanwhile annihilating his following, save one
  man. This man, who like the rest, was one of King Magnus'
  bodyguard, he bade go to his king and tell the tale, and he
  seized Kirkwall by stratagem. Jarl Ragnvald is said to have been
  a man of large stature and great strength, and to have been
  buried in Papa Westray, but a grave nearly eight feet long, that
  would fit him, has been found where he fell in Papa Stronsay.</p>

  <p>All this left Thorfinn with his great aim achieved. He was now
  sole jarl of Orkney and Shetland, and sole earl of Caithness and
  Sutherland, and he also held <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page45" id="page45"></a>[pg 45]</span> Ross and the western
  islands and coast down to Galloway, and part of Ireland, as his
  <i>rikis</i> or conquered tributary lands.</p>

  <p>The fourth and last period of his career now begins with his
  dramatic visit to King Magnus in Norway; and, on the death of
  that king, he became the friend of his successor, Harald
  Hardrada, in 1047, and after visiting King Sweyn in Denmark, and
  Henry III, Emperor of Germany, rode south to Rome probably in
  1050 along with, it is said, his cousin Macbeth, king, and a good
  king, of Scotland, returning thence to Orkney to his Hall at
  Birsay at the north-west corner of Mainland. Thorfinn went to the
  Pope not only for absolution, but to get Thorolf appointed bishop
  in Orkney, according to Adam of Bremen, c. 243.</p>

  <p>We now come to the last years of the fourth period of his
  life, when "the earl sate down quietly and kept peace over all
  his realm. Then he left off warfare, and he turned his mind to
  ruling his people and land, and to law-giving. He sate almost
  always in Birsay, and let them build there Christchurch,<a id=
  "footnotetag88" name="footnotetag88"></a><a href=
  "#footnote88"><sup>20</sup></a> a splendid Minster. There first
  was set up a bishop's seat in the Orkneys."</p>

  <p>The Annals of Tighernac record a great Norse expedition with
  the aid of the Galls of Orkney and Innse Gall and Dublin to
  subdue the Saxons in 1057, which failed. It is strange that we
  hear nothing of Thorfinn in this, and the question arises whether
  he had died before it took place. Had he been alive, such an
  expedition would hardly have been possible without him.<a id=
  "footnotetag89" name="footnotetag89"></a><a href=
  "#footnote89"><sup>21</sup></a> It is interesting to note that so
  accurate a chronicler as Sir Archibald Dunbar dates his widow
  Ingibjorg's marriage to Malcolm III in 1059. (See <i>Scottish
  Kings</i>, p. 27.)</p>

  <p>Thorfinn's life forms the subject of no less than twenty-six
  chapters of the <i>Orkneyinga Saga</i>.<a id="footnotetag90"
  name="footnotetag90"></a><a href="#footnote90"><sup>22</sup></a>
  In his childhood, and later at all the main turning points of
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg
  46]</span> his life, he was blessed with the constant care and
  touching devotion, and with the able counsel and active
  assistance of his foster-father, Thorkel Fostri, the slayer of
  his three chief competitors&mdash;Jarl Einar and Earl Moddan and
  Jarl Ragnvald Brusi-son&mdash;the captain of his armies, the
  collector of his revenues and the guardian, in his absence on his
  Viking cruises and in his travels abroad, of his widespread
  dominions. There is a tradition<a id="footnotetag91" name=
  "footnotetag91"></a><a href="#footnote91"><sup>23</sup></a> that
  Thorkel founded the rock-castle of Borve, near Farr on the north
  coast of Sutherland, which was demolished by the Earl of
  Sutherland in 1556; but Thorkel is a common name among Vikings,
  and the story is otherwise unauthenticated.</p>

  <p>According to the Saga, Thorfinn died of sickness "in the
  latter days of Harald Hardrada," (who was killed in September
  1066), near the church which he founded, in his Hall at Birsay,
  north of Marwick Head in the north-west corner of Mainland of
  Orkney, within a few miles of the scene of Earl Kitchener's
  recent death at sea, so that the greatest of our jarls and of our
  earls rest near each other, the great Viking on the shore, and
  the great soldier in the ocean.</p>

  <p>The chronology of Thorfinn and Ingibjorg his wife is extremely
  difficult, but on the whole we incline to think that he was born
  in 1008, and, as grandson of the king regnant, was created an
  earl at his birth, married Ingibjorg, then quite young, in 1044,
  and died in 1057 or 1058, after being an earl for his whole life
  of "fifty years," while his widow married Malcolm III in 1059.
  The phrase "in the latter days of Harald Hardrada" is after all
  an expression wide enough to cover the last seven years of a
  reign of twenty-one years, and it is unlikely that a marriage of
  policy would be postponed for more than the year or two after
  Malcolm's accession in 1057, during which he was engaged in
  defeating the claims of Lulach to his throne and settling his
  kingdom.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id=

  <h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

  <h3>Paul and Erlend, Hakon and Magnus.</h3>

  <p>After Earl Thorfinn's death his sons Paul and Erlend jointly
  held the jarldom, but divided the lands. They were "big men both,
  and handsome, but wise and modest"<a id="footnotetag92" name=
  "footnotetag92"></a><a href="#footnote92"><sup>1</sup></a> like
  their Norse mother Ingibjorg, known as Earls'-mother, first
  cousin of Thora, queen of Norway, mother of King Olaf Kyrre.</p>

  <p>On Thorfinn's death, however, the rest of his territories,
  nine Scottish earldoms, it is said, "fell away, and went under
  those men who were territorially born to rule over them;" that is
  to say, they reverted to Scottish Maormors;<a id="footnotetag93"
  name="footnotetag93"></a><a href="#footnote93"><sup>2</sup></a>
  but Orkney and Shetland remained wholly Norse, and under Norse
  rule.</p>

  <p>The date of the succession of Paul and Erlend to the Norse
  jarldom<a id="footnotetag94" name="footnotetag94"></a><a href=
  "#footnote94"><sup>3</sup></a> was, as we have seen, after 1057.
  Possibly in 1059, or certainly not later than 1064 or 1065,
  Ingibjorg, Thorfinn's widow, as by Norse law widows alone had the
  right to do, "gave herself away" to the Scot-King Malcolm III,
  known as Malcolm Canmore.<a id="footnotetag95" name=
  "footnotetag95"></a><a href="#footnote95"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

  <p>As a matter of policy, the marriage was a wise step. For it
  would tend to strengthen not only the hold of Scotland on
  Caithness and Sutherland, but also its connection with Orkney and
  Shetland, because Ingibjorg's sons, the young jarls Paul and
  Erlend, would become stepsons of the Scottish king and earls of
  Caithness. Nor was the marriage unsuitable in point either of the
  age or of the rank of the contracting parties. Married to
  Thorfinn about 1044,<a id="footnotetag96" name=
  "footnotetag96"></a><a href="#footnote96"><sup>5</sup></a>
  Ingibjorg, his widow, need not in 1064 have been more than forty.
  She may have been younger, and Malcolm was, in 1064, about
  thirty-three. If the marriage was in 1059, Ingibjorg would be
  only thirty-five and Malcolm <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page48" id="page48"></a>[pg 48]</span> twenty-eight. That
  Ingibjorg was not old is proved by the fact that she had by
  Malcolm one son and possibly three sons,<a id="footnotetag97"
  name="footnotetag97"></a><a href="#footnote97"><sup>6</sup></a>
  namely, Duncan II, and, it may be, also Malcolm and Donald. As
  regards rank, also, she was equal to Malcolm, being a cousin of
  the Queen of Norway, and widow of Thorfinn grandson of Malcolm
  II, the great jarl of Orkney who had then recently subdued all
  the north of Scotland and the Western Isles and Galloway to
  himself, while Malcolm III was in exile in England, whence he had
  been brought back with the greatest difficulty, not by a Scottish
  force but by the help of an English, or at least a Northumbrian
  army.</p>

  <p>After his marriage with Ingibjorg it is clear that there was
  peace for thirty years in the north of Scotland, so far as the
  Norse jarls were concerned, a fact which of itself justified the
  marriage, which, however, may have afterwards been held to have
  been within the prohibited degrees, and therefore void, while its
  issue would be held to be illegitimate, and not entitled to
  succeed to the Scottish crown.</p>

  <p>We may add that there is nothing in any Scottish record to
  prove this marriage or to disprove it.</p>

  <p>The first important event in the lives of Paul and Erlend
  happened just before the Norman conquest of England. They joined
  King Harald Sigurdson (Hardrada) and his son Prince Olaf, who was
  their second cousin on their mother's side,<a id="footnotetag98"
  name="footnotetag98"></a><a href="#footnote98"><sup>7</sup></a>
  in an attack on England; and, after Harald's death, and his
  army's defeat by King Harold Godwinson of England at Stamford
  Bridge, in September 1066, (three days before William the
  Conqueror landed at Pevensey) the two Orkney jarls were taken
  prisoner, but, along with Prince Olaf, they were released. On
  their return to Orkney, Paul asked the Archbishop of York to
  consecrate a cleric of Orkney as Bishop in Orkney, and the two
  brothers ruled harmoniously there until their sons Hakon on
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg
  49]</span> the one hand and Magnus and Erling on the other, who
  had been engaged in Viking cruises together as boys, grew up and
  quarrelled, and, as is usual, drew their fathers into the strife.
  This strife was provoked by Hakon, and apparently lasted for many
  years,<a id="footnotetag99" name="footnotetag99"></a><a href=
  "#footnote99"><sup>8</sup></a> Erlend supporting his own sons,
  and driving Hakon abroad to Norway about the year 1090. Neither
  Paul nor Erlend seems to have been much in Sutherland or
  Caithness, in which the representatives of the Gaelic Maormors or
  Chiefs probably regained power, especially the family of Moddan,
  and extended their territories.</p>

  <p>Meantime King Magnus Barelegs<a id="footnotetag100" name=
  "footnotetag100"></a><a href="#footnote100"><sup>9</sup></a> of
  Norway, instigated by Hakon, and taking advantage of the
  contentions between 1093 and 1098 of the various claimants of the
  Scottish crown, Donald Bane (whom he supported), Duncan II, and
  Edgar, had made his several expeditions, in the closing years of
  the eleventh century, against the western islands and coasts of
  Scotland and Wales. In the battle of the Menai Straits in 1098 we
  find that he had with him young Hakon Paulson, and also Erling
  and Magnus, Jarl Erlend's sons, though Magnus, who had repented
  of his early Viking ways, after declining to take part in the
  fight against an enemy with whom he had no quarrel, escaped to
  the Scottish court.<a id="footnotetag101" name=
  "footnotetag101"></a><a href="#footnote101"><sup>10</sup></a> In
  1098 King Magnus had deposed and carried off Jarls Paul and
  Erlend to Norway, where they died soon after; and in the meantime
  he had appointed his own son, Sigurd, to be ruler of Orkney and
  Shetland in their place.<a id="footnotetag102" name=
  "footnotetag102"></a><a href="#footnote102"><sup>11</sup></a> But
  on King Magnus' death, during his later expedition to Ireland,
  where Erling Erlendson probably also fell, Prince Sigurd had to
  quit Orkney in order to ascend the Norwegian throne, leaving the
  jarldom vacant for the two cousins, Hakon Paulson and Magnus
  Erlendson. The latter appears to have stayed for some years at
  the Scottish Court and afterwards with a bishop in Wales,
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg
  50]</span> and again in Scotland, but on hearing of his father's
  death, went to Caithness, where he was well received and was
  chosen and honoured with the title of "earl" about 1103. A winter
  or two after King Magnus' death, or about 1105, Hakon came back
  from Norway with the title of Jarl, seized Orkney, and slew the
  king of Norway's steward, who was protecting Magnus' share, which
  after a time Magnus claimed, only to find that Hakon had prepared
  a force to dispute his rights. Hakon agreed, however, to give up
  his claims to Magnus' half share if Magnus should obtain a grant
  of it from the Norwegian king.<a id="footnotetag103" name=
  "footnotetag103"></a><a href="#footnote103"><sup>12</sup></a>
  King Eystein about 1106 gave him this moiety and the title of
  Jarl; and the two cousins lived in amity for "many winters,"
  joining their forces and fighting and killing Dufnjal,<a id=
  "footnotetag104" name="footnotetag104"></a><a href=
  "#footnote104"><sup>13</sup></a> who was one degree further off
  than their first cousin, and killing Thorbjorn at Burrafirth in
  Unst in Shetland "for good cause." Magnus then married, probably
  about 1107, "a high-born lady, and the purest maid of the noblest
  stock of Scotland's chiefs, living with her ten winters" as a
  maiden. After "some winters" evil-minded men set about spoiling
  the friendship of the jarls, and Hakon again seized Magnus'
  share; whereupon the latter went to the court of Henry I of
  England, where he appears to have charmed everyone, and to have
  spent a year, probably 1111, in which Hakon seized all Orkney,
  and also Caithness, which then included Sutherland, and laid them
  under his rule with robbery and wantonness. Leaving Caithness,
  Hakon at once went to attack Magnus in Orkney where he had
  landed; but the "good men" intervened, and an equal division of
  Orkney and Shetland and Caithness was made between the jarls.
  After some winters, however, they met in battle array in
  Mainland, and the fight was again stopped by the principal men on
  either side in their own interest, the final settlement being
  postponed until a meeting, which was to <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg 51]</span> take
  place in Egilsay in the next spring, Magnus arrived first at the
  meeting-place with the small following of two ships agreed upon,
  but Hakon came later in seven or eight ships with a great force,
  and, after those present had refused to let both come away alive,
  Magnus was treacherously murdered under Hakon's orders by Hakon's
  cook on the 16th of April 1116. The dead jarl's mother, Thora,
  had prepared a feast in Paplay to celebrate the reconciliation of
  the two cousins, which, notwithstanding the murder, Hakon
  attended. After the banquet the bereaved mother begged her son's
  corpse for burial in holy ground, and obtained it from the
  drunken earl after some difficulty and buried it in Christ's Kirk
  at Birsay. Twenty-one years after, on the 13th December 1137,
  Jarl Magnus' relics were brought<a id="footnotetag105" name=
  "footnotetag105"></a><a href="#footnote105"><sup>14</sup></a> to
  St. Magnus' Cathedral at Kirkwall.</p>

  <p>After making due allowance for the legends which generally
  cluster round a saint or jarl, and grow with time, and for the
  desire for dramatic contrast and effect, we must give credit to
  the writer of the <i>Orkneyinga Saga</i>, probably the Orkney
  Bishop Bjarni,<a id="footnotetag106" name=
  "footnotetag106"></a><a href="#footnote106"><sup>15</sup></a> for
  the vividness and simplicity of his account of St. Magnus' life
  and of the two most striking episodes in it&mdash;his moral
  courage as a non-combatant in the battle of Menai Straits, and
  his saintly forgiveness of his murderers in his death-scene on
  Egilsay; and we must hold him worthy alike of his aureole and of
  the noble Norman cathedral afterwards erected in his memory by
  his nephew, St. Ragnvald Jarl, at Kirkwall, which took the place
  of Thorfinn's church at Birsay as the seat of the Orkney
  bishopric. Magnus, it seems, was all through assisted by the
  Scottish king, and favoured by the Caithness folk,<a id=
  "footnotetag107" name="footnotetag107"></a><a href=
  "#footnote107"><sup>16</sup></a> yet the Saga jealously claims
  him as "the Isle-earl,"<a id="footnotetag108" name=
  "footnotetag108"></a><a href="#footnote108"><sup>17</sup></a> and
  adds the following description of him:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"He was the most peerless of men, tall of growth, <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg 52]</span> manly,
  and lively of look, virtuous in his ways, fortunate in fight, a
  sage in wit, ready-tongued and lordly-minded, lavish of money and
  high spirited, quick of counsel, and more beloved of his friends
  than any man; blithe and of kind speech to wise and good men, but
  hard and unsparing against robbers and sea-rovers; he let many
  men be slain who harried the freemen and land folk; he made
  murderers and thieves be taken, and visited as well on the
  powerful as on the weak robberies and thieveries and all
  ill-deeds. He was no favourer of his friends in his judgments,
  for he valued more godly justice than the distinctions of rank.
  He was open-handed to chiefs and powerful men, but still he ever
  showed most care for poor men. In all things he kept straitly
  God's commandments."</p>

  <p>As for Hakon, his cousin Magnus' death without issue left him
  sole Jarl, "and he made all men take an oath to him who had
  before served Earl Magnus. But some winters after, Hakon ...
  fared south to Rome, and to Jerusalem, whence he sought the
  halidoms, and bathed in the river Jordan, as is palmer's
  wont.<a id="footnotetag109" name="footnotetag109"></a><a href=
  "#footnote109"><sup>18</sup></a> And on his return he became a
  good ruler, and kept his realm well at peace." He probably then
  built the round church at Orphir in Mainland of Orkney, the only
  Templar Church in Scotland.</p>

  <p>By Helga, Moddan's daughter, whom he never married, Hakon had
  a son Harald Slettmali (smooth-talker, or glib of speech), and
  two daughters, Ingibiorg and Margret. Ingibiorg afterwards
  married Olaf Bitling, king of the Sudreys; and Ragnvald
  Gudrodson, the great Viking, was of her line, and, as we shall
  see, in 1200 or thereabouts, had the Caithness earldom conferred
  upon him for a short time. To Margret we shall return later. By a
  lawful wife Hakon had another son, Paul the Silent, and it seems
  certain that Paul was not by the same mother as Margret or Harald
  Slettmali, and that Paul's mother was not of Moddan's
  family.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id=
  "page53"></a>[pg 53]</span>

  <p>Moddan, Earl of Caithness, was killed in 1040. His mother,
  daughter of Bethoc, must have been born after 1002. If she was
  married at seventeen, her son Earl Moddan could not have been
  more than twenty when killed in 1040, and any son of his must
  have been born by 1041 at latest. This son may have been Moddan
  in Dale. Dale was the valley of the upper Thurso River, the only
  great valley of Caithness, and the Saga states as
  follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Moddan<a id="footnotetag110" name=
  "footnotetag110"></a><a href="#footnote110"><sup>19</sup></a>
  "then dwelt in Dale in Caithness, a man of rank and very
  wealthy," and "his son Ottar was jarl in Thurso." Frakark, a
  daughter of Moddan in Dale, was the wife of Liot Nidingr, or the
  Dastard, a Sudrland chief, and during the half century after
  Thorfinn's death Moddan's family seems to have owned much of
  Caithness and Sutherland, where the Norse steadily lost their
  hold. We may be sure also that the Celt always kept his land, if
  he could, or, if he lost it, regained it as soon as he could.
  Amongst its members this family probably held all the hills and
  upper parts of the valleys of Strathnavern, Sutherland and Ness
  at this time, and, from a centre on the low-lying land at the
  head waters of the Naver, Helmsdale and Thurso rivers, kept on
  pressing their more Norse neighbours steadily outwards and
  eastwards.</p>

  <p>Shortly after Hakon's death in 1123, King Alexander I and his
  brother, David I, began to organise the Catholic Church in
  Scotland, and also to introduce feudalism. Even in the north of
  Scotland, between the years 1107 and 1153 they founded
  monasteries and bishoprics, and introduced Norman knights and
  barons holding land by feudal service from the Crown. Long
  thwarted in their policy by Moray and its Pictish maormors, who
  claimed even the throne itself, these two kings pushed their
  authority, by organisation and conquest, more and more towards
  the north. Alexander I founded the Bishoprics of St. Andrew's,
  Dunkeld, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id=
  "page54"></a>[pg 54]</span> and Moray in 1107, and the Monastery
  of Scone, afterwards intimately connected with Kildonan in
  Sutherland, in 1113 or 1114. David I, that "sair sanct to the
  croun," who succeeded in 1124, founded the Bishoprics of Ross and
  of Caithness in 1128 or 1130, and of Aberdeen in 1137, and
  endowed them with lands. The same king<a id="footnotetag111"
  name="footnotetag111"></a><a href=
  "#footnote111"><sup>20</sup></a> between 1140 and 1145 issued a
  mandate "to Reinwald Earl of Orkney and to the Earl and all the
  men of substance of Caithness and Orkney to love and maintain
  free from injury the monks of Durnach and their men and
  property," and also in some year between 1145 and 1153, he
  granted Hoctor Common<a id="footnotetag112" name=
  "footnotetag112"></a><a href="#footnote112"><sup>21</sup></a>
  near Durnach, to Andrew, Bishop of Caithness, whose see was then
  well established there, and he spent the summer of 1150, while he
  was superintending the building of the Cistercian abbey of
  Kinloss, in the neighbouring Castle of Duffus, whose ruins still
  stand, with Freskyn de Moravia, the first known ancestor of the
  Earls of Sutherland.<a id="footnotetag113" name=
  "footnotetag113"></a><a href="#footnote113"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

  <p>Freskyn, probably about 1130<a id="footnotetag114" name=
  "footnotetag114"></a><a href="#footnote114"><sup>23</sup></a> or
  earlier, had built this castle on the northern estate, comprising
  the parish of Spynie near Elgin and other extensive lands in
  Moray, which had been given to him in addition to his southern
  territories of Strabrock, now Uphall and Broxburn<a id=
  "footnotetag115" name="footnotetag115"></a><a href=
  "#footnote115"><sup>24</sup></a> in Linlithgowshire, which he
  already held from the Scottish king. Freskyn was thus no Fleming,
  but a lowland Pict or Scot, as the tradition of his house
  maintains,<a id="footnotetag116" name=
  "footnotetag116"></a><a href="#footnote116"><sup>25</sup></a> and
  he was a common ancestor of the great Scottish families of
  Atholl, Bothwell, Sutherland, and probably Douglas. No member of
  the Freskyn family is ever styled "Flandrensis" in any writ.</p>

  <p>We find in the extreme north of Scotland, in the first half of
  the twelfth century, apart from the Mackays, three leading
  families with great followings, which were destined to play an
  important part in the future government of Sutherland and
  Caithness, and with which we shall have to deal in detail later
  on.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg
  55]</span>

  <p>First, there was the family of the so-called Norse jarls,
  descended in twin strains from Paul and Erlend, Thorfinn's sons,
  owing allegiance to the Norwegian crown in respect of Orkney and
  Shetland and also holding the earldom of Caithness in moieties or
  in entirety, nominally from the Scottish king. Secondly, we have
  the family of Moddan, Celtic earls or maormors, with extensive
  territories held under the kings of Alban and Scotland for many
  centuries before this time, but dispossessed in part by the
  Norse. Thirdly, we have the family of Freskyn de Moravia then
  established at Strabrock in Linlithgowshire, who about 1120 or
  1130 received, for his loyalty and services, extensive lands at
  Duffus and elsewhere in Morayshire, and probably about 1196 the
  lands in south Caithness known as Sudrland or Sutherland, from
  the Scottish crown.</p>

  <p>Of this third line of De Moravias or Morays, two distinct
  branches settled north of the Oykel. First, we have Hugo Freskyn,
  son, it is said, but, as we shall see, really grandson, of the
  original Freskyn and son of Freskyn's elder or eldest son
  William.<a id="footnotetag117" name="footnotetag117"></a><a href=
  "#footnote117"><sup>26</sup></a> This William no doubt fought
  for, and may, or may not, have held land in Sutherland, but his
  son Hugo certainly had all Sutherland properly so called, that
  is, Sudrland, or the Southland of Caithness comprising the
  parishes of Creich, Dornoch, Rogart, Kilmalie (afterwards
  Golspie), Clyne, Loth, and most of Lairg and Kildonan,<a id=
  "footnotetag118" name="footnotetag118"></a><a href=
  "#footnote118"><sup>27</sup></a> formally granted to him, and he
  held also the Duffus Estates in Moray, by sea only thirty miles
  south of Dunrobin.</p>

  <p>The second branch was that of the younger Freskin de Moravia,
  great-great-grandson of the original Freskyn,<a id=
  "footnotetag119" name="footnotetag119"></a><a href=
  "#footnote119"><sup>28</sup></a> and ancestor of the Lords of
  Duffus, who obtained lands, which were mainly in modern
  Caithness, and also in the upper portion of the valley of the
  Naver and the valley of Coire-na-fearn in Strathnavern,
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg
  56]</span> by marriage with the Lady Johanna of Strathnaver about
  1250.<a id="footnotetag120" name="footnotetag120"></a><a href=
  "#footnote120"><sup>29</sup></a> This latter portion was
  immediately north of the land granted to Hugo Freskyn; and the
  Caithness portion of Johanna's lands marched with Hugo's land on
  its eastern boundary. Nor must we forget that a large area of the
  modern county of Sutherland, consisting of part of the present
  parishes of Eddrachilles and Durness and some part of Tongue and
  Farr in Strathnavern, was constantly used as a refuge by Pictish
  refugees of the race of MacHeth or MacAoidh, displaced and
  frequently driven forth from Moray after the bloody defeat of
  Stracathro in 1130 and in later rebellions as part of the policy
  of the Scottish kings, and first known as the race of Morgan and
  then to us as the Clan Mackay.</p>

  <p>They chose, indeed, for their refuge and ultimately for their
  settlements a rugged and sterile land, to which their original
  title was no charter, but their swords. Difficulties, it is said,
  make character, and nowhere is this proverbial saying better
  illustrated and proved than in the Reay country by its men and
  women. They have given their own and other countries many fine
  regiments and distinguished generals and statesmen, and none more
  so than the late Lord Reay. Their history is to be found in the
  <i>Book of Mackay</i>, a piece of good pioneer work from original
  documents by the late Mr. Angus Mackay, and also in his
  unfortunately unfinished <i>Province of Cat</i>.</p>

  <p>Yet another family, of Norse and Viking lineage, which was
  settled in Orkney from the earliest Norse times and afterwards in
  Caithness and Sutherland, was that of the Gunns, who were
  descended in the male line from Sweyn Asleifarson the great
  Viking, and on the female side from the line of Paul, and later
  were by marriage connected with the Moddan clan and with the line
  of Erlend. They have for nine centuries lived and still live in
  Sutherland and Caithness, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page57"
  id="page57"></a>[pg 57]</span> and have been noted alike for the
  beauty of their women, and for the high attainments and character
  and the distinction of their men, particularly in the art of war,
  both by land and sea.</p>

  <p>Their descent from Jarl Paul and Sweyn is clear in the Sagas
  as far as Snaekoll Gunnison and no further. It was as
  follows:&mdash;Paul Thorfinnson had four daughters, of whom the
  third was Herbjorg, who had a daughter Sigrid, who in turn had a
  daughter Herbjorg, who married Kolbein Hruga. One of their sons
  was Bishop Bjarni and their youngest child was a daughter Frida,
  who married Andres, Sweyn Asleifarson's son, and their son was
  Gunni, the father, by Ragnhild, Earl and Jarl Harald Ungi's
  sister, of Snaekoll Gunnison. We suggest later that Snaekoll
  Gunnison was the father, before his flight to Norway, of a
  daughter, Johanna of Strathnaver, who inherited the Moddan and
  Erlend estates, or that she was otherwise Ragnhild's heiress.</p>

  <p>The male line of the Gunns, according to a pedigree which the
  writer has seen, was continued after his flight by Snaekoll who,
  it is stated, had a son, Ottar, living in 1280. But after
  Snaekoll's flight his right to succeed to Ragnhild's estates was
  doubtless forfeited, and they were granted on his father's and
  mother's death to Johanna on her marriage with Freskin de Moravia
  of Duffus about 1245 or later, before Ottar's birth.</p>

  <p>With the descent of the Gunns in the male line downwards we
  are not here concerned. But Snaekoll's forfeiture probably cost
  their male line the Moddan and Erlend lands, which were granted
  to Johanna of Strathnaver in Snaekoll's absence
  abroad.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id=

  <h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

  <h3>The Moddan Family&mdash;Jarls Harald and Paul and
  Ragnvald.</h3>

  <p>From the short forecast of the future given above, let us turn
  back to the point whence we digressed, namely the year 1123, when
  Jarl Hakon Paulson died at the close of the reign of Alexander I
  of Scotland.</p>

  <p>Jarl Hakon was succeeded by his sons, Harald the Glib
  (Slettmali) and Paul the Silent (Umalgi). Jarl Paul lived mainly
  in Orkney, while Jarl Harald "was seated in Sutherland, and held
  Caithness from the Scot king" David I, who was crowned in
  1124.<a id="footnotetag121" name="footnotetag121"></a><a href=
  "#footnote121"><sup>1</sup></a> All Harald's sympathies seem to
  have been Scottish, and he was born, bred, and brought up among
  Scotsmen, or Picts, probably in North Kildonan. He was always
  there with Frakark, daughter of Moddan in Dale, then a widow, her
  husband Liot Nidingr or the Dastard being dead; and Frakark and
  her sister Helga, Jarl Hakon's mistress, "had a great share in
  ruling the land"; while Audhild, daughter of Thorleif, Frakark's
  sister, also lived with Frakark,<a id="footnotetag122" name=
  "footnotetag122"></a><a href="#footnote122"><sup>2</sup></a> and
  was the mistress at this time of one of the strangest characters
  in the Saga, Sigurd Slembi-diakn, or the Sham-deacon. Hakon's son
  Paul being, as appears certain, by a different mother not of the
  Moddan line, Frakark and Helga aimed at obtaining the whole
  jarldom of Orkney for Harald, Helga's son by Earl Hakon. With the
  object of getting rid of Paul, they went over with Sigurd
  Slembi-diakn to Orphir in Orkney; and we have the story of the
  poisoned shirt,<a id="footnotetag123" name=
  "footnotetag123"></a><a href="#footnote123"><sup>3</sup></a> made
  there by Frakark and Helga, and by them intended for Paul, but
  put on, in spite of their expostulations and entreaties, by
  Harald, who died of its poison, leaving, however, one son,
  Erlend, then an infant.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page59"
  id="page59"></a>[pg 59]</span>

  <p>After this, Jarl Paul banished these ladies from Orkney about
  1127, and they "fared away with all their kith and kin, first to
  Caithness, and then up into Sutherland to those homesteads which
  Frakark owned there,"<a id="footnotetag124" name=
  "footnotetag124"></a><a href="#footnote124"><sup>4</sup></a> and
  tradition<a id="footnotetag125" name=
  "footnotetag125"></a><a href="#footnote125"><sup>5</sup></a>
  locates her residence at Shenachu or Carn Shuin, on the east side
  of the River Helmsdale near Kinbrace above the road. Possibly,
  however, they lived at Borrobol, the "Castle Farm";<a id=
  "footnotetag126" name="footnotetag126"></a><a href=
  "#footnote126"><sup>6</sup></a> and there "there were brought up
  by Frakark Margret, Earl Hakon's daughter, and Helga, Moddan's
  daughter," and also Eric Stagbrellir, Frakark's grandnephew, and
  son of her niece Audhild by Eric Streita, a Norseman, as well as
  Olvir Rosta and Thorbiorn Klerk, both Frakark's grandsons, all of
  whom come prominently into our story. Audhild's son, Eric
  Stagbrellir, in the end was the survivor of these, as well as of
  all males of the Moddan line, and ultimately we hear of no
  descendants in Cat of any of them save of Eric, and Eric's
  marriage with Ingigerd, St. Ragnvald Jarl's only child, is the
  link between the line of Erlend and that of Moddan, which united
  the Erlend and Moddan estates.</p>

  <p>Of the line of Thorfinn we already know the royal origin and
  descent from Malcolm II's third daughter.</p>

  <p>Of the Moddan line the Saga says<a id="footnotetag127" name=
  "footnotetag127"></a><a href=
  "#footnote127"><sup>7</sup></a>&mdash;"These men were all of
  great family and great for their own sakes, and they all thought
  they had a great claim in the Orkneys to those realms which their
  kinsman Earl Harald (Slettmali) had owned. The brothers of
  Frakark were Angus of the open hand, and Earl Ottir in Thurso: he
  was a man of birth and rank." These children of Moddan were
  probably of royal lineage or kinship, as Moddan, who had been
  created Earl of Caithness by King Duncan I, was that king's
  sister's son, and was probably, as we have seen, their ancestor
  or kinsman. They were also probably descended more remotely from
  Moldan, Maormor of Duncansby, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page60" id="page60"></a>[pg 60]</span> a kinsman of Malcolm II,
  but had all been driven back from the coast, save Earl Ottir, who
  lived at Thurso, and probably owned its valley up to its source
  in the Halkirk and Latheron hills.</p>

  <p>The death of Harald the Glib by poison left Paul <i>de
  facto</i> sole jarl of Orkney. We are told<a id="footnotetag128"
  name="footnotetag128"></a><a href="#footnote128"><sup>8</sup></a>
  that "Paul was a man of very many friends, and no speaker at
  Things or meetings. He let many other men rule the land with him,
  was courteous and kind to all the land-folk, liberal of money,
  and he spared nothing to his friends. He was not fond of war, and
  sate much in quiet." We may be sure that he was little, if ever,
  in Sutherland, the country of his enemy Frakark. His rule was,
  however, destined to be disturbed, on the one hand by the Moddan
  family's plots, and, on the other hand, by a Norse competitor for
  the jarldom, Kali, son of Kol and Gunnhild, Jarl St. Magnus'
  sister, who had been re-named Ragnvald from his resemblance to
  the handsome Jarl Ragnvald Brusi's son, and was afterwards
  designated Jarl of Orkney by King Sigurd of Norway, as the
  representative of the line of Erlend, Thorfinn's son.</p>

  <p>With Jarl Ragnvald, Jarl St. Magnus' sequel in estate, and
  himself afterwards St. Ragnvald, who was much in Caithness and
  Sutherland, and seems to have held and acquired considerable
  estates there, begins what is practically a new Saga, which may
  be styled "The Story of Ragnvald, and of Sweyn" the great Viking.
  Of these two we have perhaps the finest and most vividly painted
  pictures of the <i>Orkneyinga Saga</i>, full of dramatic touches,
  full, too, of interesting historical detail.</p>

  <p>First, we have a portrait of the young Ragnvald as Kali Kolson
  in his youth at Agdir in Norway, with his mother Gunnhild, sister
  of Jarl St. Magnus Erlend's son, and his shrewd old father Kol.
  We are told that Kali was "the most hopeful man" or man of
  promise, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id=
  "page61"></a>[pg 61]</span> "of middle stature, fine of limb,
  with light brown hair"; how he "had many friends, and was a more
  proper man both in body and mind than most of the other men of
  his time, a good player at draughts, a facile writer of runes,
  and a reader of books, good at smith's work, ski-ing, shooting,
  and rowing, and as skilful at song as at the harp."<a id=
  "footnotetag129" name="footnotetag129"></a><a href=
  "#footnote129"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

  <p>At the age of fifteen, he traded to Grimsby, where many
  Norwegians and Orkneymen came, and many from the Hebrides; and
  here he met Harald Gillikrist, who became his firm friend, and
  confided in him alone that he, Harald, was the son of King Magnus
  Barelegs, asking how he would be received by King Sigurd of
  Norway, and obtaining the diplomatic reply that he would be well
  received by the king, if others did not spoil his welcome. Then
  Kali returns to Bergen in 1116, about the time of Jarl Magnus'
  murder by his cousin Jarl Hakon, and after a friendship and a
  feud with Jon Peterson, which is amicably settled by the marriage
  of Jon with Kali's sister Ingirid, and of which the description
  well illustrates the manners and law of the times, is made Jarl
  Ragnvald of Orkney by King Sigurd; and on that king's death in
  1126 he is confirmed in the title by his friend King Harald, for
  whom he fought in the battle for the throne at Floruvoe near
  Bergen, when King Magnus was captured, maimed, and deposed by
  Harald in 1135.</p>

  <p>Jarl Paul, however, refused to part with half the isles; and,
  acting on Kol's advice, Jarl Ragnvald's messengers apply for aid
  in obtaining it to Frakark and her grandson Olvir Rosta in
  Kildonan, and offer them Paul's half share if they will help
  Ragnvald to secure his half. Frakark, having previously arranged
  that her niece Margret, the daughter of Earl Hakon and Helga,
  should marry Earl Maddad of Athole, second cousin to David I, as
  his second wife, thought that Orkney might be had, with half the
  jarldom and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id=
  "page62"></a>[pg 62]</span> all Caithness, for Margret's son
  Harold Maddadson, then an infant in arms.</p>

  <p>Ragnvald and Frakark then made common cause.<a id=
  "footnotetag130" name="footnotetag130"></a><a href=
  "#footnote130"><sup>10</sup></a> But in 1136 Paul defeated
  Frakark's ships in a sea fight off Tankerness in Deer Sound in
  Orkney, and immediately afterwards seized Jarl Ragnvald's fleet
  in Yell Sound in Shetland, though Ragnvald and his men escaped to
  Norway in merchant vessels, to return later on.<a id=
  "footnotetag131" name="footnotetag131"></a><a href=
  "#footnote131"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

  <p>Meantime Olvir Rosta, Frakark's grandson, who had been stunned
  and nearly drowned in the sea fight at Tankerness, in which
  Sweyn's and Gunni's father, Olaf Hrolf's son, had aided Jarl
  Paul, burned Olaf alive in his home at Duncansby, Asleif, Olaf's
  wife, escaping only because she was absent at the time. Further,
  Valthiof, Sweyn's elder brother, was drowned in the roost of the
  West-firth, while rowing south to Jarl Paul's Yule Feast. Sweyn
  Asleifarson, as he was ever afterwards called, then went to
  Paul's Hall at Orphir to complain of Olvir Rosta. The news of his
  brother's death, which arrived during the feast, was
  considerately withheld from him, and he was greatly honoured
  there; but he roused the jarl's anger by slaying Sweyn
  Breast-rope, the jarl's forecastle-man, at Orphir, not indeed so
  much for the murder, as because Sweyn had fled and did not come
  to submit himself after it to the jarl, and so offended
  him.<a id="footnotetag132" name="footnotetag132"></a><a href=
  "#footnote132"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

  <p>Then follow the stories, well worth reading in the Saga
  itself, of the raising and lowering of the sails on Ragnvald's
  ships and of the mutiny of Paul's followers, and of the dowsing
  of the beacons on the Fair Isle by Uni, Ragnvald's ally, of
  Ragnvald's landing in Westray, of his suppression of all
  opposition to him, of the spies at Paul's Thing, of Sweyn's
  junction of forces with Ragnvald, of Sweyn's visit to Margret at
  Athole, and his dramatic kidnapping of Jarl Paul while hunting
  otters near Westness<a id="footnotetag133" name=
  "footnotetag133"></a><a href="#footnote133"><sup>13</sup></a> in
  the Isle of Rousay, in Orkney, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page63" id="page63"></a>[pg 63]</span> and of the jarl's
  deportation by Sweyn first to Dufeyra and thence via
  Ekkjals-bakki<a id="footnotetag134" name=
  "footnotetag134"></a><a href="#footnote134"><sup>14</sup></a> to
  Athole to his sister Margret, who receives him with the utmost
  show of cordiality, and finally of Paul's abdication in favour of
  Margret's second son, Harold Maddadson, then a boy of five years
  of age, with the instructions to Sweyn to tell the Orkneymen that
  Paul himself was blinded, or, worse still, maimed, so that his
  friends should not seek him out, and restore him to his
  jarldom.<a id="footnotetag135" name="footnotetag135"></a><a href=
  "#footnote135"><sup>15</sup></a> Such is one version of the
  story; the other is a more sinister tale, that his half-sister
  Margret cast Jarl Paul into a dungeon and had him murdered, and,
  so far as the Saga relates, he left no issue.</p>

  <p>Sweyn then returns to Orkney and tells his version of the
  affair to the bishop, the bishop to Ragnvald, and Ragnvald to the
  "good men" or <i>lendirmen</i> of Orkney, who express themselves
  satisfied, and Ragnvald builds the Cathedral he had vowed to St.
  Magnus in Kirkwall&mdash;a strange medley of craftiness, murder,
  and piety.</p>

  <p>Next we have the vivid scene<a id="footnotetag136" name=
  "footnotetag136"></a><a href="#footnote136"><sup>16</sup></a> of
  the arrival from Athole at Knarstead near Scapa, in his blue cope
  and quaintly cut beard, on a fine winter's day, of John, Bishop,
  probably of Glasgow, and formerly tutor to King David of
  Scotland, on whom Jarl Ragnvald waits like a page, and who passes
  on to Egilsay to Bishop William the Old; and the two clerics
  propose to Jarl Ragnvald that Harald Maddadson, who had already
  been created sole Earl of Caithness, shall have Paul
  Thorfinnson's half of the Orkney jarldom, an arrangement which
  Ragnvald accepts, and which is ratified by the people of Orkney
  and of Caithness. In due course the boy arrives in 1139, and the
  tutor selected for him is, of all others, Frakark's grandson,
  Thorbiorn Klerk, who had married Sweyn Asleifarson's sister,
  Ingirid, and who was "one of the boldest of men, and the most
  unfair, overbearing man in most <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page64" id="page64"></a>[pg 64]</span> things,"<a id=
  "footnotetag137" name="footnotetag137"></a><a href=
  "#footnote137"><sup>17</sup></a> differing indeed but little in
  character from Sweyn himself "who was a wise man and foresighted
  about many things; and an unfair overbearing man and reckless
  towards others," while they were both said to be men "of power
  and weight," and at this time they were fast friends.</p>

  <p>Then follows the story of Frakark's Burning, one of the most
  purely Sutherland tales in the whole Saga.<a id="footnotetag138"
  name="footnotetag138"></a><a href=
  "#footnote138"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

  <p>Sweyn, to avenge on that lady and her grandson, Olvir Rosta,
  the burning of his own father Olaf and of his house in Duncansby,
  openly asked Jarl Ragnvald for "two ships well fitted and
  manned," sailed to the Moray Firth, the Breithifiorthr or
  Broadfirth, as it was then called, "and took the north-west wind
  to Dufeyra, a market town in Scotland. Thence he sailed into the
  land along the shore of Moray and to Ekkjals-bakki. Thence he
  fared next of all to Athole to Earl Maddad, and lay at the place
  called Elgin and obtained guides, who knew the paths over fells
  and wastes whither he wished to go.<a id="footnotetag139" name=
  "footnotetag139"></a><a href="#footnote139"><sup>19</sup></a>
  Thence he fared the upper way over fells and woods, above all
  places where men dwelt, and came out in Strath Helmsdale near the
  middle of Sutherland. But Olvir and his men had scouts out
  everywhere where they thought that strife was to be looked for
  from the Orkneys; but in this way they did not look for warriors.
  So they were not ware of the host, before Sweyn and his men had
  come to the slope at the back of Frakark's homestead. There came
  against them Olvir the Unruly with sixty men; then they fell to
  battle at once, and there was a short struggle. Olvir and his men
  gave way towards the homestead; for they could not get to the
  wood. Then there was a great slaughter of men, but Olvir fled
  away up to Helmsdale Water and swam across the river and so up on
  to the fell: and thence he fared to Skotland's Firth,<a id=
  "footnotetag140" name="footnotetag140"></a><a href=
  "#footnote140"><sup>20</sup></a> and so out to the Southern
  Isles. And he is out of the story. But when Olvir drew off, Sweyn
  and his <span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id=
  "page65"></a>[pg 65]</span> men fared straight up to the house,
  and plundered it of everything; but, after that, they burnt the
  homestead and all those men and women who were inside it. And
  there Frakark lost her life. Sweyn and his men did there the
  greatest harm in Sutherland, ere they fared to their ships."</p>

  <p>Such is this Sutherland tale of Sweyn. According to the
  current notions of blood feud, he merely discharged the solemn
  duty of avenging his father's burning and death by a like burning
  and slaying of the household of his father's murderers. But his
  acts were wholly unjustifiable by the law of the time, as he had
  already accepted an atonement by were-geld from Earl Ottar.</p>

  <p>After a round of harrying and piracy, especially in
  Sutherland, no doubt among the Moddan clan, Sweyn was heartily
  welcomed home by Jarl Ragnvald, from whom he immediately obtained
  another fleet for another set of raids on Wales, the coasts of
  the Bristol Channel and the Scilly Isles. His murder of Sweyn
  Breast-rope was committed just after an adjournment of the feast
  at Orphir for Nones in the Templar Church there, and Jarl
  Ragnvald's gift of the ships for Frakark's punishment was made
  while the jarl was piously engaged in completing and adorning St.
  Magnus' Cathedral at Kirkwall.</p>

  <p>The strategy leading up to the Burning is characteristic of
  Sweyn and his stratagems. He <i>openly</i> asks for ships and
  sails in them, and thus is expected to land on the coast. But
  after a purposely devious course, which has puzzled inquirers
  into the locality of Ekkjals-bakki, he came overland by Oykel and
  Lairg and Strathnaver or Strathskinsdale, whence he was not
  looked for.</p>

  <p>Thorbiorn Klerk next has his revenges. First he burnt Earl
  Waltheof (who had slain his father) in Moray, and next he killed
  two of Sweyn's men who <span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id=
  "page66"></a>[pg 66]</span> had assisted in the burning of
  Thorbiorn's relative, Frakok, or Frakark, in Kildonan. Jarl
  Ragnvald with difficulty reconciles Thorbiorn and Sweyn, and they
  start for a joint raid. Soon, however, they squabble over the
  spoils, and Thorbiorn puts his wife Ingirid, Sweyn's sister,
  away, a deed that reopened their feud.<a id="footnotetag141"
  name="footnotetag141"></a><a href=
  "#footnote141"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

  <p>For a series of robberies in Caithness, Sweyn is besieged by
  Jarl Ragnvald in Lambaborg, now known as Freswick Castle, but
  escapes by swimming in his armour under the cliffs and landing in
  Caithness, whence he passed southwards through Sutherland to
  Scotland and Edinburgh, where King David I received him with
  honour, and reconciled him with Jarl Ragnvald.<a id=
  "footnotetag142" name="footnotetag142"></a><a href=
  "#footnote142"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

  <p>In 1148, Ragnvald decided to visit King Ingi in Norway, taking
  Harold Maddadson, then a boy of fifteen, with him.<a id=
  "footnotetag143" name="footnotetag143"></a><a href=
  "#footnote143"><sup>23</sup></a> There he meets Eindridi, who had
  been long in Micklegarth, as Constantinople was then called by
  the Norse, probably in the Emperor's service as one of the
  Varangian Guard; and ships are built for a voyage to the East.
  But both he and Harold are wrecked in "The Help" and "The Arrow,"
  at Gulberwick, south of Lerwick, on the Shetland coast, all on
  board, however, being saved, and Ragnvald, as usual, making
  verses and fun of it all, and of many other things.</p>

  <p>At last in 1150 Ragnvald's and Eindridi's ships are
  "boun"<a id="footnotetag144" name="footnotetag144"></a><a href=
  "#footnote144"><sup>24</sup></a> for their eastern cruise,
  Eindridi, however, being wrecked off Shetland. But he gets
  another ship, and, in 1151, they set sail for the East, William,
  the bishop of Orkney, commanding one vessel. Passing down the
  east coast of England and through the Channel to France, they
  reach Bilbao<a id="footnotetag145" name=
  "footnotetag145"></a><a href="#footnote145"><sup>25</sup></a> in
  Spain, where Ragnvald lands, and refuses to marry Queen
  Ermengarde. Afterwards he rounds Galicia, where Eindridi's
  treachery robs them of spoil in taking Godfrey's castle, beats
  through Niorfa Sound (the Straits of Gibraltar); <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg 67]</span> is
  deserted by Eindridi, sails along Sarkland (Barbary), captures
  the Saracen ship Dromund, and burns her, sells the prisoners in
  Barbary, but releases their prince, coasts along Crete, lands at
  Acre, and bathes in Jordan on St. Lawrence's Day, the 10th of
  August 1152. After a visit to Jerusalem they come at last to
  Constantinople, where the Varangian Guard heartily welcome them,
  although Eindridi, who has arrived there before him, tries to set
  everyone against them; and Ragnvald finally returns to Bulgaria
  and Apulia and Rome, and thence overland to Denmark and
  Norway.<a id="footnotetag146" name="footnotetag146"></a><a href=
  "#footnote146"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

  <p>When Ragnvald reached Norway in 1153, he heard what had been
  going on at home during his absence in the east. King Eystein of
  Norway, King Harald Gilli's son, had seized Jarl Harold
  Maddadson, then a young man of twenty, at Thurso, and made him
  swear allegiance to himself, letting him go on his paying three
  marks of gold as his ransom. Then Maddad, his father, Earl of
  Athole, died; and the widowed Margret, Harold's mother, came
  north to Orkney, still dangerous, still beautiful and attractive,
  especially to Gunni, Sweyn's brother, by whom she had a child,
  for which Gunni was outlawed, a punishment which alienated his
  brother Sweyn from Harold Maddadson.<a id="footnotetag147" name=
  "footnotetag147"></a><a href="#footnote147"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

  <p>Erlend, only son of Harald Slettmali, and really entitled to
  the whole earldom, obtained from his relative<a id=
  "footnotetag148" name="footnotetag148"></a><a href=
  "#footnote148"><sup>28</sup></a> King Malcolm, then a boy of
  under twelve, through his powerful kin, a grant of half of the
  earldom of Caithness jointly with Harold Maddadson, who objected
  to give him half the Orkney jarldom unless King Eystein confirmed
  the grant. Erlend then went to Norway to get it confirmed.
  Meantime Sweyn seized a ship of Harold's; but, to help Erlend,
  tried to reconcile Harold to him, as King Eystein (said Erlend)
  had given him half of Orkney. And the half given to him was, he
  added, Harold's half.<a id="footnotetag149" name=
  "footnotetag149"></a><a href=
  "#footnote149"><sup>29</sup></a></p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg 68]</span>

  <p>Sweyn and Erlend then force Harold, who had then just come of
  age, to agree to give up this half, under duress, in order to
  secure his own liberty, and the Orkney folk agree that Erlend
  shall have this half, Ragnvald having the other. This, Sweyn
  knew, Harold would not stand, and, as he drank at a feast with
  his house-carles in his castle in Gairsay,<a id="footnotetag150"
  name="footnotetag150"></a><a href=
  "#footnote150"><sup>30</sup></a> the wily Viking said, slily
  rubbing his nose, "I think Harold is now on his voyage to the
  isles," a shrewd surmise which proved correct in spite of the
  midwinter storm then prevailing. Harold's expedition, however,
  failed, and he went back to Caithness to raise a force to kill a
  man called Erlend the Young who had seized his mother Margret and
  taken her by force to Shetland, where he fortified Mousa
  Broch<a id="footnotetag151" name="footnotetag151"></a><a href=
  "#footnote151"><sup>31</sup></a> and held her prisoner there.
  After a siege, Harold, who had followed them, at last allowed
  their marriage, Erlend the Young becoming his ally, and going
  that summer with his wife and Harold to Norway. When that was
  heard in the Orkneys, Sweyn and Earl Erlend went raiding off the
  east coast of Scotland and afterwards a-viking to North Berwick,
  and got much plunder, and Harold returned in the autumn to
  Orkney. In the winter Jarl Ragnvald came back from the east to
  Turfness (Burghead), whence he went about Yule 1153 to Orkney, to
  find that the Orkney-men want himself and Erlend, not himself and
  Harold, as joint jarls over them.</p>

  <p>Harold had then to fight for his own hand; and, finding that
  Earl Erlend and Sweyn were in Shetland, he sought them out but
  missed them, and afterwards, though he hated Jarl Ragnvald, tried
  to get him on his side.</p>

  <p>We come to another Sutherland event, historically of the first
  importance to us, in 1154.<a id="footnotetag152" name=
  "footnotetag152"></a><a href="#footnote152"><sup>32</sup></a>
  "Jarl Ragnvald was then up the country in Sutherland, and sat
  there at a wedding at which he gave his only daughter and child
  Ingirid or Ingigerd, to Eric Stagbrellir," who, <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg 69]</span> as we
  have seen, as Audhild's son, had been brought up in Kildonan.
  "News came to him at once that Earl Harold was come into Thurso.
  Jarl Ragnvald, rode down with a great company to Thurso from the
  bridal.<a id="footnotetag153" name="footnotetag153"></a><a href=
  "#footnote153"><sup>33</sup></a> Eric was Harold's kinsman and
  tried to reconcile the earls."</p>

  <p>There was a fight in Thurso between their followers, Thorbiorn
  Klerk instigating it, no doubt because after Eric's marriage with
  Ingigerd, Ragnvald's daughter, he knew he could not hope to force
  Eric to give up the Moddan lands in Strathnavern and in the upper
  valleys and hills of Sudrland and Caithness, to which he had a
  claim. Thirteen of Ragnvald's men fell in the fray, and he
  himself was wounded in the face. Ultimately, the earls were
  reconciled on the 25th of September 1154, and about 1156 joined
  forces and went to Orkney against Sweyn and Erlend, who pretended
  they were sailing for the Hebrides, but put their ships about at
  Store<a id="footnotetag154" name="footnotetag154"></a><a href=
  "#footnote154"><sup>34</sup></a> Point in Assynt, and after all
  but seizing Jarl Ragnvald at Orphir in Orkney, captured his
  ships, though he and Harold escaped, each in a small boat, across
  the Pentland Firth to Caithness.<a id="footnotetag155" name=
  "footnotetag155"></a><a href="#footnote155"><sup>35</sup></a>
  Returning thence, in Sweyn's absence for the night they attacked
  Erlend, who had disregarded all Sweyn's warnings and advice to
  keep a good look-out, off Damsey, near Finstown. In this fight
  Jarl Erlend, the last descendant in the male line of Thorfinn
  then alive, was slain, while drunk, his body being found next day
  transfixed by a spear, and he left no issue to inherit his title
  of earl or the other Moddan lands, left to him by Earl Ottar,
  which probably devolved on Eric Stagbrellir in 1156, as he could
  hold them against Thorbiorn Klerk.</p>

  <p>All Erlend's success, if we are to believe the Saga, this
  portion of which is written largely to glorify Sweyn, probably by
  his relative Bishop Bjarni, had been arranged by Sweyn's really
  marvellous cunning; <span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id=
  "page70"></a>[pg 70]</span> and Ragnvald, no doubt feeling how
  dangerous an enemy Sweyn was, and that he was backed by the
  Scottish king, immediately sent for him in order to reconcile him
  to Harold. But Harold, soon afterwards, robbed Sweyn's house in
  Gairsay; and Sweyn, in his turn, attacked the house where Harold
  was, and nearly succeeded in burning him alive. Later on Harold
  all but caught Sweyn off Kirkwall, but Sweyn gave him the slip,
  by running his ship into a tidal cave in Ellarholm, off Elwick in
  Shapinsay, in 1155, and disappearing till the coast was clear,
  when he got away in a small boat.</p>

  <p>Afterwards Sweyn and Earl Harold were reconciled, and Sweyn
  and Thorbiorn Klerk and Eric Stagbrellir went on a viking cruise
  to the Hebrides, and, after a great victory at the Scilly Isles,
  returned with much booty to Orkney.<a id="footnotetag156" name=
  "footnotetag156"></a><a href="#footnote156"><sup>36</sup></a></p>

  <p>In the year 1157 or 1158, Sweyn defeated Gilli Odran, steward
  of Earl Ragnvald's lands in Caithness, who had fled to the west
  and was caught in Murkfjord (possibly Loch Glendhu at Kylestrome
  in Eddrachilles) and was slain there with fifty of his men by
  Sweyn.<a id="footnotetag157" name="footnotetag157"></a><a href=
  "#footnote157"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

  <p>In 1158, Ragnvald and Harold went, as they did every year, to
  hunt red deer and reindeer<a id="footnotetag158" name=
  "footnotetag158"></a><a href="#footnote158"><sup>38</sup></a> in
  Caithness, their hunting ground being probably near the
  Ben-y-griams, which lay on the way to Kildonan, or Strathnaver,
  where Eric probably lived; and some think there are still remains
  of walls used as a pen for driven deer on Ben-y-griam Beg, though
  these are more probably the ancient ramparts of a
  hill-fort.<a id="footnotetag159" name=
  "footnotetag159"></a><a href="#footnote159"><sup>39</sup></a>
  When they landed at Thurso, they heard that Thorbiorn Klerk was
  hiding and lying in wait in Thorsdale<a id="footnotetag160" name=
  "footnotetag160"></a><a href="#footnote160"><sup>40</sup></a> in
  order to make an onslaught on Ragnvald, if he got a chance. After
  riding with a band of a hundred men, twenty of them mounted, they
  spent the night at a place where there was what the Celts call an
  "erg" (<i>airigh</i>) but the Norse call "setr," the modern
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg
  71]</span> sheiling. Next day, as they rode up along Calfdale,
  Ragnvald was in advance of the party, and, at a homestead called
  Force,<a id="footnotetag161" name="footnotetag161"></a><a href=
  "#footnote161"><sup>41</sup></a> Halvard hailed him loudly by
  name. Thorbiorn was inside the house, and burst out through an
  old doorway, and dealt Ragnvald a great wound, and the jarl fell,
  his foot sticking in his stirrup, when Stephen, an accomplice,
  gave him a spear thrust; whereupon Thorbiorn, after dealing him
  another wound, and receiving a spear thrust in the thigh himself,
  fled to the moor. Earl Harold at first would not interfere; and
  though Magnus son of Havard Gunni's son insisted, Earl Harold
  again declined to pursue Thorbiorn to the death, but left Magnus
  to besiege him at Asgrim's Ergin or Shielings,<a id=
  "footnotetag162" name="footnotetag162"></a><a href=
  "#footnote162"><sup>42</sup></a> now Assary, near Loch Calder,
  where, by setting fire to the hut in which he was, his pursuers
  succeeded in smoking him out and killing him. They then brought
  the jarl's body from Force to Thurso, and thence took it over to
  Orkney, to be buried in the choir of St. Magnus' Cathedral, which
  he had founded and built in his uncle's honour.</p>

  <p>"Jarl Ragnvald's death was a very great grief, for he was very
  much beloved there in the Isles, and far and wide elsewhere." It
  took place on the 20th August 1158.</p>

  <p>"He had been a very great helper," the Saga adds, "to many
  men, bountiful of money, gentle, and a steadfast friend; a great
  man for feats of strength, and a good skald" or poet. In 1192 he
  was canonised as St. Ragnvald<a id="footnotetag163" name=
  "footnotetag163"></a><a href="#footnote163"><sup>43</sup></a>
  with, it is said, full Papal sanction. Save during Harold
  Maddadson's minority he was never Earl of Caithness, and then had
  the title only as guardian of his ward Harold.</p>

  <p>Ragnvald left a daughter, his only surviving child, Ingirid or
  Ingigerd, whom as we have seen, Audhild's son, Eric Stagbrellir
  had married four years before her father's death; and their
  children, who come into <span class="pagenum"><a name="page72"
  id="page72"></a>[pg 72]</span> the story afterwards, were three
  sons, Harald Ungi or Harald the Young, Magnus nick-named Mangi,
  and Ragnvald, and three daughters, Ingibiorg, Elin<a id=
  "footnotetag164" name="footnotetag164"></a><a href=
  "#footnote164"><sup>44</sup></a> and Ragnhild, all of whom, so
  far as the Saga relates, died childless save Ragnhild, whose son
  by her second husband Gunni, was Snaekoll Gunni's son, who about
  1230 claimed the Ragnvald lands in Orkney from Earl John, son of
  Earl Harold Maddadson,<a id="footnotetag165" name=
  "footnotetag165"></a><a href="#footnote165"><sup>45</sup></a> and
  complained that Earl John was keeping him out of his rights in
  Caithness to Ragnvald's share of the earldom lands there.</p>

  <p>After Thorbiorn Klerk's death, Olvir Rosta being "out of the
  story," Eric's children, who were mainly Norse in blood, were the
  only heirs left in Caithness not only for Jarl Ragnvald's lands,
  but also for the upper parts of the river valleys of Strathnavern
  and Ness, which the Moddan family had held through the whole
  Norse occupation of Caithness and Sutherland, along with the hill
  country in Halkirk and Latheron and Strathnavern and probably
  also in Sutherland, lands on which few Norse place-names are
  found, and which came to Eric through Audhild his mother on the
  deaths of Earls Ottar and Erlend Haraldson without issue. These
  lands would of right descend to Eric's eldest son, Harald Ungi,
  and on his death without issue, to his brothers if alive, and,
  failing them, to his sisters and their heirs, as happened in the
  case of Ragnhild and her son Snaekoll Gunni's son, neither
  Ingibiorg nor Elin receiving any share of this property, for
  reasons now undiscoverable, but which we shall endeavour to
  explain later, by presuming that one of them had died unmarried,
  or had married abroad, while the other and her descendants were
  amply provided for otherwise by marriage with Gilchrist, Earl of
  Angus.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id=

  <h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

  <h3>Harold Maddadson and the Freskyns.</h3>

  <p>After the death of Jarl Ragnvald in 1158, Harold Maddadson at
  the age of twenty-five "took all the isles under his rule, and
  became sole chief over them."<a id="footnotetag166" name=
  "footnotetag166"></a><a href="#footnote166"><sup>1</sup></a> Ever
  since 1139 he had been sole Earl of Cat save for Erlend
  Haraldson's grant,<a id="footnotetag167" name=
  "footnotetag167"></a><a href="#footnote167"><sup>2</sup></a>
  though Jarl Ragnvald seems to have had a share of its lands and
  managed the Earldom of Caithness for Harold during his minority,
  bearing the title of his ward till the latter attained his
  majority in 1154. Harold had married Afreka, daughter of Duncan,
  Earl of Fife, one of the most loyal supporters of the Scottish
  kings, and their children were two sons, Henry, who afterwards
  claimed Ross, and of whom we hear no more, and Hakon, Sweyn
  Asleifarson's foster-child, and two daughters, Helena and
  Margret, of whom we hear nothing save their names. Hakon, from
  boyhood, went with Sweyn on all his spring and autumn "vikings"
  or piratical cruises, undertaken every year to the Hebrides, Man,
  and Ireland, in one of which Sweyn took two English ships near
  Dublin, and returned to Orkney laden with broadcloth, wine, and
  English mead.<a id="footnotetag168" name=
  "footnotetag168"></a><a href="#footnote168"><sup>3</sup></a>
  Sweyn's life is thus described in c. 114 of the <i>Orkneyinga
  Saga</i>. "He sat through the winter at home in Gairsay, and
  there he kept always about him eighty men at his beck. He had so
  great a drinking-hall that there was not another as great in all
  the Orkneys. Sweyn had in the spring hard work, and made them lay
  down very much seed, and looked much after it himself. But when
  that toil was ended, he fared away every spring on a
  Viking-voyage, and harried about among the southern isles and
  Ireland, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id=
  "page74"></a>[pg 74]</span> and came home after midsummer. That
  he called spring-viking. Then he was at home until the cornfields
  were reaped down, and the grain seen to and stored. Then he fared
  away on a viking-voyage, and then he did not come home till the
  winter was one month spent, and that he called his
  autumn-viking." At last, in a cruise to Dublin, which he
  captured, Sweyn was killed by stratagem on landing to receive
  payment of its ransom from the town, and the boy Hakon probably
  fell there with him in 1171. "And," the Saga adds, "it is the
  common saying of Sweyn that he was the most masterful man in the
  western lands, both of yore and now-a-days, among those men who
  had no higher rank than himself." Sweyn was, in fact the greatest
  man of his time. For he robbed whom he pleased, made and undid
  jarls and earls as he chose, and was the friend or tool of more
  than one Scottish king.</p>

  <p>Earl Harold had put his wife Afreka away, and probably after
  Sweyn's death formed a union, at a date which it seems impossible
  to fix, with Hvarflod or Gormflaith, daughter of Malcolm MacHeth
  of Moray, who was in rebellion in 1134, and was imprisoned in
  Roxburgh Castle until 1157, when he was released and created Earl
  of Ross, so that Gormflaith, who could hardly have been born
  during her father's imprisonment, must have been born either
  before 1135 or after 1157. Harold and Gormflaith's children were
  Thorfinn, who predeceased him, and also David and John, both
  afterwards in succession earls of Caithness and jarls of Orkney,
  and three daughters, Gunnhilda, Herborga, and Langlif; and of the
  daughters the Saga-writers tell us nothing, except that the
  Icelander S230;mund, Magnus Barelegs' grandson, wished to marry
  Langlif but did not do so;<a id="footnotetag169" name=
  "footnotetag169"></a><a href="#footnote169"><sup>4</sup></a> and
  her son Jon Langlifson, according to the Saga of Hakon was in
  1263 a spy on the Norse side.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page75" id="page75"></a>[pg 75]</span>

  <p>Here the <i>Orkneyinga Saga</i> ends. But additions to its
  generally received text are found in the <i>Flatey
  Book</i>,<a id="footnotetag170" name=
  "footnotetag170"></a><a href="#footnote170"><sup>5</sup></a> and
  the additions are by no means so trustworthy as the Saga proper.
  From these we learn that of Eric Stagbrellir and Ingigerd's
  children, who were settled in Sutherland, the sons, Harald Ungi,
  Magnus, and Ragnvald Eric's son, fared east to Norway to King
  Magnus Erling's son, where young Magnus Eric's son fell with that
  king in the battle of Norafjord in Sogn in 1184.<a id=
  "footnotetag171" name="footnotetag171"></a><a href=
  "#footnote171"><sup>6</sup></a> Probably some of them were, on
  Eric Stagbrellir's death, subjected to exactions in respect of
  their lands by Harold Maddadson.</p>

  <p>Having arrived, under the guidance of the <i>Orkneyinga</i>,
  at the closing years of the 12th century, so far as the affairs
  of Orkney and Shetland and Sutherland and Caithness are
  concerned, it remains for us to turn and observe the tide of
  civilisation and order which under our Scottish kings was now
  setting strongly northwards and ever further north in each
  successive reign, the Catholic Church and the feudal baron being
  the chosen instruments of national organisation and discipline,
  and the charter being the method of establishing them in the
  land.</p>

  <p>To this tide the Pictish and Columban Churches, and the
  Province of Moray and its Maormors had formed the main barriers
  and obstacles; and the Saxon nobility, introduced by the elder
  sons of Malcolm Canmore's second queen, St. Margaret, had proved
  quite unable to break them down. The Pict of Moray was
  obstinately hostile to the Scots, and his leaders and rulers
  aspired to, and claimed the crown of Scotland itself. Rebellion
  after rebellion took place, and it was not until King David I had
  introduced the feudal baron with his mail-clad tenants, and
  settled them on the land by charter, that any success in
  establishing peace and civil order was achieved in the vast
  Pictish province of Ross and Moray, which stretched across
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg
  76]</span> Scotland from the North Sea to the Minch, and whose
  people resisted to the utmost.</p>

  <p>It is not part of our purpose to treat generally of the feudal
  and largely Norman families, which gradually asserted their power
  over the Picts in the north, and were accepted as Chiefs, such as
  were the Umphraville Earls of Angus, the Roses of Kilravock, the
  Chisholms of Strath Farrer, the Bissets and Fresels or Frasers of
  Beauly, the Grants of Moray and Inverness, and the Comyns of
  Badenoch; for none of these held land north of the Oykel. But
  later on in the thirteenth century we shall have more
  particularly to note the Chens or Cheynes in Caithness, and the
  Scottish or Pictish family of Freskyn of Strabrock and Moray, in
  its two branches, that of Hugo of Sutherland and that of his
  grandson Freskin the younger in Sutherland and Caithness.</p>

  <p>Of Freskyn or Fretheskin I, the founder of the line, we have
  no mention in any charter direct to him,<a id="footnotetag172"
  name="footnotetag172"></a><a href="#footnote172"><sup>7</sup></a>
  either of his Linlithgowshire lands at Strabrock, or of his
  estate near Spynie in Moray with its Castle at Duffus.</p>

  <p>To us he is as Melchizedek; for neither his father nor his
  mother is known. We believe him to have been born before 1100,
  and so to have been a contemporary of Frakark, Thorbiorn Klerk,
  and Olvir Rosta, of Jarl Ragnvald, of Margret of Athole, Erlend
  Haraldson and Sweyn, and also of Harold Maddadson; and to have
  won his Duffus estate, as an addition to his lands at Strabrock,
  about 1120 or at latest 1130, before or after the crushing
  defeat, at Stracathro, of the Picts of Angus and Moray; and
  between these dates to have built the Castle of Duffus on the
  bank of Loch Spynie, in order to check Norse raids on the Moray
  coast while the Norse held Turfness or Burghead; and we know that
  he entertained King David I there during the whole summer of
  1150, while that king was <span class="pagenum"><a name="page77"
  id="page77"></a>[pg 77]</span> superintending the building of the
  Abbey of Kinloss. From notices in a charter of King William the
  Lion granting and confirming to Freskyn's son, William, his
  father's lands of Strabrock in West Lothian and of Duffus,
  Roseisle, Inchkeile, Macher and Kintrai,<a id="footnotetag173"
  name="footnotetag173"></a><a href="#footnote173"><sup>8</sup></a>
  forming almost the whole parish of Spynie, we believe him to have
  been dead by 1166, or, at the latest, 1171, the year of Sweyn
  Asleifarson's death, and we know that he held all these lands
  from David I, with probably many more in Moray. Contrary to the
  general impression, it seems probable that Freskyn had not one
  son, but two sons, William above mentioned and also Hugo, who
  witnessed a charter, not necessarily spurious, granting
  Lohworuora, now Borthwick, Church to Herbert, bishop of Glasgow,
  about 1150. But of this Hugo's existence we have no definite
  record, and of him we know nothing more than that he witnessed
  the document above referred to, and one other about 1195, namely,
  a Charter of Strathyla, in which the words occur "Willelmo filio
  Freskyn, Hugone filio Freskyn" quoted by Shaw, page 406, App. No.
  xxvii, in the edition of 1775. This Hugo thus seems to have been
  uncle of, and not identical with Hugo de Moravia, grantee of
  Sutherland, known as Hugo Freskyn.</p>

  <p>William, son of Freskyn, held those lands in West Lothian and
  Moray probably until near the end of the twelfth century; and
  this William, son of Freskyn, had at least three sons,<a id=
  "footnotetag174" name="footnotetag174"></a><a href=
  "#footnote174"><sup>9</sup></a> (1) Hugo Freskyn, the ancestor of
  the de Moravias, or Murrays, of Sutherland, (2) William of Petty,
  and (3) Andrew, parson<a id="footnotetag175" name=
  "footnotetag175"></a><a href="#footnote175"><sup>10</sup></a> of
  Duffus, who appears in a writ as a son of Freskyn, and as a
  brother of Hugo Freskyn of Sutherland.<a id="footnotetag176"
  name="footnotetag176"></a><a href=
  "#footnote176"><sup>11</sup></a> Andrew was alive in 1190, and
  lived probably till 1221, and has been taken to have been the
  same person as Andrew Bishop of Moray who built Elgin Cathedral.
  More probably he was that Bishop's uncle, and refused the
  bishopric of Ross. He witnessed the great Charter <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg 78]</span> of
  Bishop Bricius founding the Cathedral at Spynie between 1208 and
  1215. (Reg. Morav. c. 39).</p>

  <p>William, son of Freskyn, probably had several other sons from
  one of whom were descended the Earls of Atholl.<a id=
  "footnotetag177" name="footnotetag177"></a><a href=
  "#footnote177"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

  <p>William, son of William, and so grandson of Freskyn, with
  whom, as he was not interested in Caithness or Sutherland, we
  have nothing to do, frequently appears as witness to charters in
  and after 1195 along with his elder brother Hugo, whom in one
  charter, William being the younger, is reported to call "his lord
  and brother."<a id="footnotetag178" name=
  "footnotetag178"></a><a href="#footnote178"><sup>13</sup></a>
  This William, son of William son of Freskyn, was lord of Petty,
  near Fort George, and of Bracholy, Boharm, and Artildol, and died
  before 1226, leaving an eldest son Walter of Petty, a cousin of
  Sir Walter of Duffus, and from Walter of Petty are descended the
  great family, notorious in Orkney, of Bothwell, his
  great-great-grandson having been Sir Andrew of Bothwell, Wardane
  of Scotland, who died in 1338. William of Petty, to whom and
  whose descendants we now bid adieu, was probably sheriff of
  Invernarrin or Invernairn in 1204,<a id="footnotetag179" name=
  "footnotetag179"></a><a href="#footnote179"><sup>14</sup></a> and
  uncle of another William who became first earl of Sutherland.</p>

  <p>In Hugo, the elder son of William son of Freskyn, we are
  deeply interested. For, if his father "William son of Freskyn"
  had no grant of Sutherland, Hugo Freskyn certainly had not only
  such a grant but possession as well. Two Charters, the <i>Carta
  de Suthirland</i> and <i>Alia Carta Suthirlandiae</i> appear in
  the list of documents in the Treasury of Edinburgh in 1282, and
  one or both of these may have been the original grant or grants
  of his Sutherland estate.<a id="footnotetag180" name=
  "footnotetag180"></a><a href="#footnote180"><sup>15</sup></a>
  They may, on the other hand, have been the later grants of the
  earldom, or still later charters relating to it. They have,
  however, disappeared.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding their disappearance, ample evidence of the
  tenure of the estate of Sutherland by Hugo <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg 79]</span> Freskyn
  has been preserved until the present day in the Charter-room at
  Dunrobin; and the documents are happily as legible as they were
  over 700 years ago.</p>

  <p>By a charter,<a id="footnotetag181" name=
  "footnotetag181"></a><a href="#footnote181"><sup>16</sup></a>
  dated about 1211, Hugo granted to Master Gilbert, Archdeacon of
  Moray and to those heirs of his family whom he should choose and
  their heirs, all his land of Skelbo in Sutherland and of
  Fernebuchlyn and Inner-Schyn, and also his whole land of
  Sutherland towards the west which lay between the aforenamed land
  and the marches of Ross, to be held to himself and to his own
  heirs for ever from the granter and his heirs, performing for
  such lands the service of one bowman and the forinsec service due
  to the king in respect of such lands; and this grant was
  confirmed by King William the Lion (who died in December 1214) on
  the 29th of April, probably in 1212, at Seleschirche, now
  Selkirk, and was also confirmed by Hugo's son William, Lord of
  Sutherland, about 1214.<a id="footnotetag182" name=
  "footnotetag182"></a><a href="#footnote182"><sup>17</sup></a>
  This renders it certain that Hugo himself had died before
  December 1214, the latest possible limit of the date of this
  charter. He was buried in the Church of Duffus, as the Register
  of Moray states,<a id="footnotetag183" name=
  "footnotetag183"></a><a href="#footnote183"><sup>18</sup></a> and
  he can hardly have been the Hugo who witnessed the Charter of the
  Church of Lohworuora sixty-two years at least before, to which
  Prince Henry, who died in 1152, was a witness.<a id=
  "footnotetag184" name="footnotetag184"></a><a href=
  "#footnote184"><sup>19</sup></a> For Hugo of Sutherland would
  then have been too young to have been selected as a witness, and
  he was not Hugo, son of Freskyn (Hug. filio Fresechin), but
  Freskyn's grandson.</p>

  <p>Hugo Freskyn of Sutherland had three sons, (1) William,
  great-grandson of the original Freskyn, <i>dominus</i> or Lord of
  Sutherland, and afterwards first earl, (2) Walter, who succeeded
  to Strabrock in Linlithgowshire and to Duffus and the family
  estates in Moray, which were thus severed in ownership from
  Sutherland, and (3) Andrew. Walter of Duffus <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg 80]</span> married
  Euphamia, daughter of the most able and renowned general of his
  time, Ferchar Mac-in-Tagart, Earl of Ross;<a id="footnotetag185"

  Walter de Moravia, and lived till 1243, but was dead by 1248, his
  widow surviving him, and later on we shall come to another
  Freskin, their eldest son, (who was <i>dominus de Duffus</i> on
  20th March 1248), in Strathnaver and Caithness. Hugo's third son,
  Andrew, was the parson of Duffus<a id="footnotetag186" name=
  "footnotetag186"></a><a href="#footnote186"><sup>21</sup></a> who
  became Bishop of Moray, and moved the see from Spynie to Elgin,
  where he erected a specially beautiful Cathedral, the predecessor
  of that whose splendid ruins still stand. According to the
  Chronicle of Melrose he died in 1242.</p>

  <p>Hugo Freskyn's eldest son, William, Lord of Sutherland, was
  simply "William de Sutherlandia" on the 31st August 1232, and "W.
  de Suthyrland" appears as a witness to a grant of a mill on 10th
  October 1237. But William, Hugo's son, was by Alexander II
  created Earl of Sutherland, as we hope to show, soon after 1237,
  probably as a reward for long and loyal service to William the
  Lion and to Alexander II, between the year 1200 and the date of
  his creation, in the various difficulties and rebellions in Moray
  and Caithness, between which two centres of disaffection his
  territory of Sutherland lay.<a id="footnotetag187" name=
  "footnotetag187"></a><a href="#footnote187"><sup>22</sup></a> For
  William's family had then its "three descents" and more, and its
  chief had a sufficient body of retainers settled on the land to
  entitle him to the dignity of an earldom. That he was earl there
  is no doubt, because a deed of 1275 settling litigation between
  the Earl William of that date and the Bishop of Caithness refers
  to William of glorious memory and William his son, <i>earls of
  Sutherland, nobiles viros, Willelmum clare memorie et Willelmum
  ejus filium, comites Sutthirlandie</i>, (c.f. The Sutherland
  Book, p. 7).</p>

  <p>The first four generations of the Freskyn family seem to be
  also clearly proved in one line of a grant by William the Lion to
  Gaufrid Blundus, burgess of <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page81" id="page81"></a>[pg 81]</span> Inverness, of 2nd May
  (year omitted) which is attested "Willelmo filio Freskin Hugone
  filio suo et Willelmo filio ejus," which is strange Latin, but
  embraces all four generations. It is quoted in the New Spalding
  Club's Records of Elgin, p. 4, as from Act Parl. Scot, vol. 1, p.
  79. The Charter is dated at Elgin probably near the end of the
  twelfth century, when William Mac-Frisgyn, Hugo, and William of
  Sutherland were all alive. Not a single member of the family was,
  as every Fleming was, styled "Flandrensis" in any charter or
  writ, and Fretheskin is probably a Gaelic name, of which the
  latter part may mean "knife" or "dagger." The name does not mean
  Flemish or Frisian.</p>

  <p>Having now introduced the various prominent persons in the
  north of Scotland over seven hundred years ago, both on the Norse
  and on the Scottish sides, let us now look more closely and in
  detail at the main events which had been taking place there and
  elsewhere since the end of the reign of David I, when his
  grandson Malcolm IV, known as The Maiden, succeeded in 1153.</p>

  <p>The first event in the brilliant reign of this boy king was
  the invasion and plundering of Aberdeen by Eystein king of Norway
  about 1153,<a id="footnotetag188" name=
  "footnotetag188"></a><a href="#footnote188"><sup>23</sup></a> in
  repelling which the feudal Barons of Moray and Angus, including
  the first Freskyn of Duffus and his son William MacFrisgyn, must
  have been of service. In the same year Somarled of Argyll and the
  sons of MacHeth engaged in a joint rebellion, which lasted three
  years until the eldest of them, Donald, was taken and placed as a
  prisoner with his father in Roxburgh Castle, leaving Somarled to
  continue the war alone. This war was put an end to by the release
  of Malcolm MacHeth, who was created Earl, probably of Ross,<a id=
  "footnotetag189" name="footnotetag189"></a><a href=
  "#footnote189"><sup>24</sup></a> after another civil war in
  Somarled's own country had called Somarled back to the Isles; and
  the young king Malcolm joined Henry II of England in his wars in
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg
  82]</span> France. During King Malcolm's absence abroad Fereteth,
  Earl of Stratherne, and five other earls, of whom Harold
  Maddadson was probably one, rebelled in 1160; and, on failing in
  an attempt to kidnap the young king, who had returned to quell
  the disturbance, the six earls were reconciled to him; and in the
  same year he subdued another rising in Galloway, and yet another
  in Moray. The subjugation of Moray is said to have been carried
  out with the greatest severity. According to Fordun<a id=
  "footnotetag190" name="footnotetag190"></a><a href=
  "#footnote190"><sup>25</sup></a> the king "removed the rebel
  nation of Moray men and scattered them throughout the other
  districts of Scotland, both beyond the hills and this side
  thereof," though Robertson in his <i>Early Kings</i> expresses
  the opinion that this clearance took place in the reign of David
  his predecessor.<a id="footnotetag191" name=
  "footnotetag191"></a><a href="#footnote191"><sup>26</sup></a> He
  is probably right, but whenever it took place, it doubtless gave
  Sutherland the first of its Mackays, originally MacHeths, who
  were at first refugees from Moray, and ultimately in the
  thirteenth century are found settled in Durness in the
  north-western parts of the modern county of Sutherland. It was at
  this time, too, that the Innes family, afterwards so well known
  in Caithness and Sutherland, were, in the person of Berowald the
  Fleming, given their lands in Moray,<a id="footnotetag192" name=
  "footnotetag192"></a><a href="#footnote192"><sup>27</sup></a>
  William MacFrisgyn, Freskyn's eldest son, and father of Hugo
  Freskyn of Sutherland, witnessing the charter, a neighbourly turn
  which has ever since caused some to believe wrongly that the
  Freskyns were Flemings.</p>

  <p>Malcolm next defeated another rising by Somarled, who was
  killed in 1164, by treachery or surprise, in a skirmish at
  Renfrew,<a id="footnotetag193" name="footnotetag193"></a><a href=
  "#footnote193"><sup>28</sup></a> and was not Somarled the
  freeman, who is said in the <i>Orkneyinga Saga</i> to have been
  slain by Sweyn in the Isles, in his pursuit and defeat of Gilli
  Odran in the Myrkfjord about seven years earlier.<a id=
  "footnotetag194" name="footnotetag194"></a><a href=
  "#footnote194"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

  <p>Then King Malcolm, after a short but brilliant reign, died in
  his 24th year. He was succeeded by his <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg 83]</span> brother
  William the Lion, who was forthwith crowned at Scone on Christmas
  Eve 1165 in his twenty-second year.</p>

  <p>We may now try to state how things stood in the north at the
  date of his accession. Soon after this time his grandfather's
  friend, the first Freskyn, died between 1166 and 1171, and was
  succeeded by his son William MacFrisgyn, whose son Hugo would
  then be quite young. Harold Maddadson had in 1165 been for
  twenty-six years Earl of Caithness, and Jarl of Orkney and
  Shetland for nineteen years jointly with Ragnvald, and for seven
  years sole jarl of those islands.<a id="footnotetag195" name=
  "footnotetag195"></a><a href="#footnote195"><sup>30</sup></a> He
  had probably put away his first wife Afreka of Fife about 1165,
  but he afterwards lived with Gormflaith, the daughter of Malcolm
  MacHeth from a date which cannot be fixed with certainty. Led by
  her, it is said, Harold was openly hostile to the Scottish king,
  of whom, however, he held the earldom of Caithness, which at that
  time included not only the parishes of Creich, Dornoch, Rogart,
  Kilmalie or Golspie, Clyne, Loth, and most of Kildonan and of
  Lairg, then called by the Norse Sudrland, but also the districts
  of Strathnavern, Eddrachilles, and Durness (where Mackay refugees
  had not yet permanently settled) as well as Ness, which is now
  known as the County of Caithness.</p>

  <p>The diocese of Caithness, which then was co-terminous with the
  earldom and comprised all the above districts which now form the
  modern counties of Caithness and Sutherland, had in 1165 been in
  existence for about thirty-five years; its chief church being at
  first at Halkirk in Caithness and thereafter being the old Church
  of St. Bar at Dornoch, but it was scantily endowed, and therefore
  its clergy were but few.<a id="footnotetag196" name=
  "footnotetag196"></a><a href="#footnote196"><sup>31</sup></a> Its
  Bishop was Andrew, a Culdean monk of Dunfermline, and probably
  Abbot of Dunkeld, who had been promoted to the see of Caithness
  before 1146, and died at Dunfermline on the 30th December 1184.
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg
  84]</span> Ingigerd, Earl Ragnvald's daughter, would at this time
  be a young wife and mother living with some of the elder of her
  six children, probably near Loch Naver, on part of the Moddan
  family lands there with her husband, Audhild's son Eric
  Stagbrellir, until their sons, Harald Ungi, Magnus, and Ragnvald,
  should grow up. But these sons, possibly on their father's death,
  and certainly before 1184, when young Magnus Mangi was
  killed<a id="footnotetag197" name="footnotetag197"></a><a href=
  "#footnote197"><sup>32</sup></a> at the battle of Norafjord,
  emigrated to Norway to obtain the Orkney jarldom about ten or
  fifteen years after King William's accession; while of Ingigerd's
  daughters, Ingibiorg, Elin, and Ragnhild, nothing is recorded at
  this time, though Ragnhild appears later on, and one of her
  sisters is believed to have married Gilchrist, Earl of Angus
  during the last twenty years of the twelfth century. The other
  may have married in Norway, or died young and unmarried.</p>

  <p>All these children and their descendants successively
  according to sex and seniority would have claims as being of the
  line of Erlend Thorfinnson, to half the Caithness earldom and
  Jarl Ragnvald's lands there, claims which, however, it would be
  impracticable, while Harold Maddadson lived, to enforce.</p>

  <p>Harold Maddadson's children by his first wife, namely Henry of
  Ross, Hakon, Helena and Margaret would, in 1165, all be born, but
  would be well under twenty-one, while of his second family, if
  Gormflaith was born by 1135, which is unlikely, his eldest son,
  Thorfinn could have been born, and some of the others. Thorfinn
  is mentioned by name in a grant<a id="footnotetag198" name=
  "footnotetag198"></a><a href="#footnote198"><sup>33</sup></a> of
  a silver mark per annum to the Church of Scone issuing out of
  Harold's lands, of which the date is after 1166, but no one can
  say how much before the 30th December 1184, the date of the death
  of one of its witnesses, Andrew, Bishop of Caithness.</p>

  <p>If the union with Gormflaith took place after 1174, no child
  of that union would exist until 1175. That <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg 85]</span> this is
  in fact true is rendered more probable because their union is not
  mentioned in the <i>Flatey Book</i> until after the death of
  Sweyn in 1171. But the passage is of doubtful authenticity, (see
  Rolls Edition p. 224), and inconclusive even if genuine. From the
  various allusions to Harold's union with Gormflaith, it would
  seem that Harold lived with her before he married her for many
  years, but married her legally after his first wife Afreka's
  death after 1198 when William the Lion stipulated that he should
  take Afreka back, and the subsequent legal marriage might in
  those days, under the Canon and Roman law, suffice to make
  Gormflaith's children, though born in adultery, legitimate and
  capable of succeeding to the earldom (see Dalrymple's
  Collections, p. 221).</p>

  <p>In 1165 Sweyn Asleifarson, the great Viking, would be cruising
  on the northern and western coasts with Harold's son, Hakon, on
  board, until their deaths in Dublin in 1171.</p>

  <p>As for those in authority, Harold Maddadson would have as
  contemporaries, Freskyn of Duffus till his death between 1166 and
  1171, and his son William till his death near the end of the 12th
  century, when Hugo, son of William, would succeed to the
  Morayshire estates, though probably he had previously obtained a
  grant of the land then known as Sudrland or Sutherland, which is
  defined above. Hugo probably received this grant after William
  the Lion's first conquest of Sutherland and Caithness in 1196,
  shortly before the time when, as we shall see, Harald Ungi
  obtained in right of his mother a grant of half Orkney from the
  Norse king, and another from the king of Scotland of half
  Caithness, and probably a confirmation of his title to the Moddan
  lands in Strathnaver and in Halkirk and Latheron, to which he was
  heir in right of his father and grandmother Audhild of the Moddan
  line. But this half of Caithness would be conferred <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg 86]</span> on
  Harald Ungi subject to the prior grant of Sudrland to Hugo
  Freskyn. For Harold Maddadson must, in the opinion of so eminent
  an authority as Lord Hailes, have been forfeited in 1196, if not
  earlier, for both he and his son Thorfinn were then in open
  rebellion against the Scottish Crown.<a id="footnotetag199" name=
  "footnotetag199"></a><a href="#footnote199"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

  <p>Further deprivations of lands, it is conjectured, must have
  attended Harold Maddadson's later rebellions, and the events
  which must have led to those deprivations may now be recounted,
  though it is very difficult to reconcile Scottish and Norse
  records during the period.</p>

  <p>In 1179 King William the Lion had marched an army into Ross,
  and subdued it to his sway; and, ere he left it, caused two
  castles of Eddirdovir on the site of Redcastle in the Black Isle
  on the Beauly Firth, and of Dunskaith<a id="footnotetag200" name=
  "footnotetag200"></a><a href="#footnote200"><sup>35</sup></a> on
  the northern Suter of Cromarty, which is full of Norse remains,
  to be built, to enable him to hold his conquests.</p>

  <p>Two years later he made war on Donald Ban MacWilliam, who
  claimed the Scottish Crown itself, as the third son of William
  FitzDuncan only son of Duncan II, who was himself the eldest son
  of Malcolm Canmore by Malcolm's first marriage, so productive of
  civil war in Scotland, with Ingibjorg, widow of Earl Thorfinn.
  Civil war ensued, and lasted for six or seven years, when, by
  good luck, Roland of Galloway fell in with a force of the rebels
  at an unknown spot called Mamgarvie near Inverness, and routed
  them, killing Donald Ban MacWilliam there on the 31st July
  1187.<a id="footnotetag201" name="footnotetag201"></a><a href=
  "#footnote201"><sup>36</sup></a></p>

  <p>In 1196, Harold Maddadson, who through the ambition of
  Gormflaith had, as we have seen, designs on Ross and Moray, sent
  an expedition southwards to occupy those districts, of which
  probably Gormflaith's father, Malcolm MacHeth, had been Earl at
  his death after 1160. But William collected an army,<a id=
  "footnotetag202" name="footnotetag202"></a><a href=
  "#footnote202"><sup>37</sup></a> and, <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg 87]</span> after
  defeating Harold's son Thorfinn near Inverness, crossed the
  Oykel, entered Sutherland, subdued it and Caithness, and pursued
  Harold up to his castle at Thurso, and destroyed it in his sight.
  Harold then submitted, and promised to surrender his son and
  heir, Thorfinn, as a hostage, with others of his friends to be
  delivered to the king at Nairn. Harold left all his hostages
  close by at Lochloy, and went alone to the king at Nairn, and
  endeavoured to excuse himself by offering two grandsons to the
  king and stating that Thorfinn was his heir<a id="footnotetag203"
  name="footnotetag203"></a><a href=
  "#footnote203"><sup>38</sup></a> and could not therefore be given
  up; but was taken prisoner himself and lodged in Edinburgh
  Castle, till his son Thorfinn came to take his place. On this
  occasion Harold Maddadson was deprived of Sudrland or Sutherland,
  which had been given to Hugo Freskyn; and in the next year, or
  soon after, half of the earldom of Caithness, which the <i>Flatey
  Book</i> states Jarl Ragnvald had held,<a id="footnotetag204"
  name="footnotetag204"></a><a href=
  "#footnote204"><sup>39</sup></a> was conferred by King William
  the Lion on Harald Ungi or The Young, as grandson of Jarl
  Ragnvald, and son of Eric, who, however, had to make good the
  grant by conquest. Harald Ungi had, as stated above, already
  obtained a grant from King Sverri of half Orkney by a visit to
  the Norwegian Court.</p>

  <p>In order to enforce his rights under both these grants, Harald
  Ungi collected a force, and, together with Sigurd Murt, and
  Lifolf Baldpate, the first husband of his youngest sister
  Ragnhild, invaded Orkney, while Harold the Old fled to the Isle
  of Man; but, on his namesake following him thither, he doubled
  back to Orkney, and, after killing all the adherents of his
  enemies there, crossed over to Caithness with a strong force. In
  a pitched battle "near Wick," said to have been fought at
  Clairdon near Thurso, he slew Harald Ungi, and utterly defeated
  his army, in 1198.<a id="footnotetag205" name=
  "footnotetag205"></a><a href="#footnote205"><sup>40</sup></a>
  Harold the Old then endeavoured to make terms with the king, and
  offered him a large sum for the redemption of <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg 88]</span>
  Caithness. The king, however, attached as conditions to any
  regrant, that the earl should put away Gormflaith, the daughter
  of MacHeth, and take back his wife, Afreka of Fife, and deliver
  up Laurentius, his priest, and Honaver, son of Ingemund, as
  hostages.<a id="footnotetag206" name=
  "footnotetag206"></a><a href="#footnote206"><sup>41</sup></a> The
  earl, on his part, refused the terms; and, the earldom thus
  remaining forfeited, King William at once invited Ragnvald
  Gudrodson, the great Viking king of the Sudreys and Man, and then
  his friend and ally, to assemble a force and drive Harold out of
  Caithness, promising to confer that earldom upon his general, if
  successful in the campaign.</p>

  <p>Ragnvald Gudrodson, it may here be noted, had, if we pass over
  his own illegitimacy, in the absence of direct male heirs of Earl
  Hakon since Erlend Haraldson's death in 1156, probably the best
  title to receive a grant of the jarldom of Orkney and Shetland
  and the earldom of Caithness of all the surviving descendants of
  Earl Thorfinn Sigurd's son. For Ragnvald Gudrodson was the
  grandson of Ingibjorg, Earl Hakon's elder daughter, while Harold
  Maddadson was the son of Ingibjorg's younger sister, Margret of
  Athole. Ragnvald Gudrodson's title was, but for his own
  illegitimacy (in spite of which he held his own kingdom) equal,
  if not superior to that of all survivors of the Erlend
  Thorfinnson line, which was now represented in the male line only
  by another Ragnvald the son of Eric Stagbrellir, who would claim,
  in default of male heirs of Jarl St. Magnus, through the female
  line of Erlend Thorfinnson, as being descended successively from
  Gunnhild, Erlend's daughter, her son Ragnvald Jarl and Saint, and
  Ingigerd his only child. And there is no proof that Ragnvald
  Ericson was alive at this date, or that he ever returned from
  Norway to prefer his claim.</p>

  <p>Ragnvald Gudrodson forthwith collected a great army in Ireland
  and the Sudreys and invaded <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page89" id="page89"></a>[pg 89]</span> Caithness,<a id=
  "footnotetag207" name="footnotetag207"></a><a href=
  "#footnote207"><sup>42</sup></a> and, meeting Harold Maddadson in
  battle at Dalharrold,<a id="footnotetag208" name=
  "footnotetag208"></a><a href="#footnote208"><sup>43</sup></a>
  where the River Naver issues from the loch, drove him northwards
  down the strath to the coast, whence he escaped to Orkney. The
  Saga says simply that Harold stayed in Orkney, and this location
  of the battle near Achness rests solely on tradition, which,
  however, in the Highlands, is often a solid enough
  foundation.</p>

  <p>King William next conferred the earldom on Ragnvald Gudrodson,
  for, it is said, a considerable sum of money, reserving his own
  annual tribute.</p>

  <p>On receiving the earldom, Ragnvald Gudrodson left in charge of
  Caithness six<a id="footnotetag209" name=
  "footnotetag209"></a><a href="#footnote209"><sup>44</sup></a>
  stewards, of whom Lagmann Rafn was the chief, and went back to
  the Isle of Man. Harold had one of these stewards murdered by an
  assassin, and returned with a large force to Thurso to punish the
  Caithness folk; and, when Bishop John interceded for the people
  of his diocese, Harold, whom he had irritated by refusing to
  collect the Peter's Pence which the Earl had given to Rome, would
  not listen to him, but mutilated him, probably in 1201, nearly
  blinding him, and all but cutting out his tongue, though
  afterwards the bishop regained his sight and speech in some
  measure, and may have lived to administer his diocese till 1213.
  It is noteworthy that Pope Innocent III, in his letter of 1202,
  does not directly blame Harold for the illtreatment of the
  bishop, but Lumberd, a layman, whose penance the letter
  prescribes.</p>

  <p>Harold then drove out the stewards, and they fled to the
  Scottish king, who made the best amends he could to them,<a id=
  "footnotetag210" name="footnotetag210"></a><a href=
  "#footnote210"><sup>45</sup></a> and Rafn, the Lawman, seems to
  have returned and to have lived and enforced the law in Caithness
  until at least 1222.<a id="footnotetag211" name=
  "footnotetag211"></a><a href="#footnote211"><sup>46</sup></a></p>

  <p>To punish Earl Harold, King William at once had Harold's son
  Thorfinn blinded and so mutilated in Roxburgh Castle that he died
  there. William also <span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id=
  "page90"></a>[pg 90]</span> collected a large army and marched in
  person to Eysteinsdal or Ousedale near the Ord of Caithness, and
  Harold, though he is said to have brought together seven thousand
  two hundred men, avoided battle and evaded the king's
  pursuit.<a id="footnotetag212" name="footnotetag212"></a><a href=
  "#footnote212"><sup>47</sup></a> Harold also began negotiations
  with King John of England and received a safe conduct for a
  journey to England to see him.<a id="footnotetag213" name=
  "footnotetag213"></a><a href="#footnote213"><sup>48</sup></a></p>

  <p>Later in the year Harold is said to have recovered his earldom
  through the intercession of Bishop Roger of St. Andrews, for a
  payment of two thousand pounds of silver, which Munch conjectures
  may have been handed over to Ragnvald Gudrodson to replace the
  sum which he had paid to the king for the earldom; and it is true
  that we hear no more of Ragnvald in connection with Caithness,
  though he lived until 1229. At the same time, we can hardly
  believe that Harold, as the <i>Flatey Book</i> says, received
  back "all Caithness as he had it before that Earl Harald the
  Young took it from the Skot-king."<a id="footnotetag214" name=
  "footnotetag214"></a><a href="#footnote214"><sup>49</sup></a>
  What happened probably was, that Harold Maddadson, who had been
  stripped by King Sverri of Shetland in 1195,<a id=
  "footnotetag215" name="footnotetag215"></a><a href=
  "#footnote215"><sup>50</sup></a> was allowed by King William in
  1202 to keep part of his Caithness earldom upon payment by its
  inhabitants of a fine of every fourth penny they possessed.
  Otherwise his son David could not have succeeded to any part of
  Caithness, as he undoubtedly did, when, four years later, in
  1206, his father's long and chequered career of sixty-eight years
  in the earldom was closed by his death at the age of
  seventy-three.</p>

  <p>Ugly of countenance, but of great bodily strength and stature,
  crafty, self-seeking, treacherous and wholly unscrupulous, he is
  still known in the North as "the wicked Earl Harold," yet the
  Saga classes him with Sigurd Eysteinsson and Thorfinn Sigurdson
  as one of the three greatest of the Jarls and Earls of Orkney and
  Caithness.</p>

  <p>On the mainland, no new earldom north of the Oykel
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg
  91]</span> was conferred on anyone for a further period of thirty
  years. It was, in fact, neither the policy nor, save in very
  exceptional cases, the practice of the Scottish kings to grant
  earldoms to men with powerful followings and vast
  territories;<a id="footnotetag216" name=
  "footnotetag216"></a><a href="#footnote216"><sup>51</sup></a> for
  these made them, especially in remote situations, almost
  independent rulers, and dangerous enemies, and it was undesirable
  to increase their importance by additional dignities. It was, on
  the contrary, usual by charter to create barons and other
  military tenants, who should hold their lands, described in their
  charters, by military service, in male succession direct from the
  Scottish Crown, and liable to forfeiture for disloyal conduct.
  Nowhere were military tenants so essential as they then were in
  the extreme north of Scotland on lands immediately adjoining the
  territories of Norse jarls owing double allegiance, and therefore
  of doubtful loyalty to the Scottish Crown. For this reason also
  no part of the lands of the Erlend line would be granted to the
  line of Paul, as an addition to their own.</p>

  <p>From what has been above stated, it will appear that we have
  treated the well known history, intituled <i>The Genealogie and
  Pedigree of the Earles of Southerland</i> and written down to
  1630 by Sir Robert Gordon, Baronet of Gordonstoun, and continued
  by Gilbert Gordon of Sallach<a id="footnotetag217" name=
  "footnotetag217"></a><a href="#footnote217"><sup>52</sup></a>
  until 1651, as mere fiction as regards all persons before
  William, first Earl. "Alane Southerland, Thane of Southerland,"
  Walter "first Earle," Robert, second earl, who is alleged to have
  founded "Dounrobin Castell" were purely fictitious persons. "Hugh
  Southerland, Earle of Southerland nicknamed Freskin" existed, but
  never was an earl, as Sir Robert well knew, because he quotes
  charters right up to his death, in which he was styled simply
  Hugo Freskyn. The <i>Sutherland Book</i> also wholly omits
  William MacFrisgyn, second Lord of Duffus and Strabroc, the son
  and heir of Freskyn I and the father <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg 92]</span> of
  Hugo. A revised pedigree of the early generations of Freskyn's
  family will be found in an Appendix to this book, and it is
  believed to be correct. At the same time it is in conflict as to
  the first three generations with so high an authority as the late
  Cosmo Innes, and Sir William Fraser followed him. However this
  may be, it is abundantly clear, from contemporary and undoubtedly
  authentic records still happily extant, that in the twelfth
  century Freskyn de Moravia and his immediate successors were the
  guardians appointed by one Scottish king after another to protect
  the fertile coast lands of Moray and Nairn alike against the race
  of MacHeth from the hills and the Norse invader from the sea; and
  that on the extensive territories which they possessed, they
  built stately castles and endowed cathedrals and churches with
  lands and tithes, providing from their family not only high
  ecclesiastical dignitaries to serve them, but distinguished
  soldiers and administrators to give them peace; services which
  their successors in the thirteenth century were, in their turn,
  destined to repeat and continue in Sutherland, Strathnavern and
  Caithness, when the old Norse earldom there had been broken up
  and effectively incorporated in the kingdom of
  Scotland.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id=

  <h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

  <h3>Earls David and John.</h3>

  <p>On the death of Earl Harold Maddadson in 1206, he was followed
  in the earldom of Orkney, without Shetland, by his elder
  surviving son, David, who also, it would seem, was allowed to
  succeed to the Caithness earldom and some of its territory. But
  out of the Caithness earldom there had been taken the lands
  forming the Lordship of Sudrland or Sutherland held by Hugo
  Freskyn from about 1196, and this comprised, as already stated,
  the parishes of Creich, (then including Assynt), Dornoch, Rogart,
  Kilmalie (now Golspie), Clyne, Loth, and by far the greater part
  of the parishes of Kildonan and Lairg. Out of these lands Hugo
  granted, as already stated, to his relative Gilbert de Moravia,
  Archdeacon of Moray from 1204 till 1222, and to his heirs and
  assigns whomsoever, all Creich and much of Dornoch parish up to
  the boundaries of Ross, and the date of this grant was probably
  about 1211. The Mackays were beginning to occupy the western
  parts of Strathnavern, their title being probably their swords,
  and they held their lands "manu forti," their country being a
  refuge for their Morayshire kinsmen, the MacHeths, who were in
  constant rebellion. The eastern portion of Strathnavern, and
  particularly the neighbourhood of Loch Coire and Loch Naver, and
  all the Strathnaver valley were probably insecurely held by
  members of the Erlend and Moddan family after Harald Ungi's death
  at the battle of Clairdon in 1198; and Gunni, probably a grandson
  of Sweyn Asleifarson, who had married Ragnhild, Harald Ungi's
  youngest sister, after the death in the same battle of Lifolf
  Baldpate, her first husband, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page94" id="page94"></a>[pg 94]</span> became chief of the
  Moddan Clan there and in Caithness. After 1200 Ragnhild had by
  Gunni a son called Snaekoll Gunni's son, who thus became, on his
  father's death, the chief representative in Scotland, both of the
  Moddan family and of the line of Jarls Erlend Thorfinnson, St.
  Magnus, and St. Ragnvald, and of Eric Stagbrellir and of Earl and
  Jarl Harald Ungi; and Snaekoll afterwards laid claim to their
  possessions in Orkney, as the sole male representative of this
  line. Gunni and Ragnhild must have held the Strathnaver lands,
  and the Moddan family lands in Caithness, formerly Earl Ottar's
  estates, till their deaths, and Snaekoll was their sole known
  male heir. The Harald Ungi share of the Caithness earldom lands,
  which <i>The Flatey Book</i> and <i>Torfaeus</i> state that Jarl
  Ragnvald had held, does not appear to have been granted to David,
  or to any successor to the Caithness earldom of his line, or to
  any other person at this time. Indeed, the line of Paul were the
  last persons to whom such a grant would be made.</p>

  <p>It was, therefore, to a very much reduced territory and
  earldom that David succeeded in 1206, as Earl of Caithness. We
  hear almost nothing of him, save that for the latter part of the
  eight years of his rule,<a id="footnotetag218" name=
  "footnotetag218"></a><a href="#footnote218"><sup>1</sup></a> more
  or less inefficient probably through ill health, he shared the
  earldom and what had been left to him of its lands with his
  younger brother John. David died without issue in 1214<a id=
  "footnotetag219" name="footnotetag219"></a><a href=
  "#footnote219"><sup>2</sup></a> probably soon after Hugo Freskyn,
  and David was succeeded by his brother John in the jarldom of
  Orkney and in the reduced earldom of Caithness as sole jarl and
  earl.</p>

  <p>Immediately after David's death, King William the Lion, who
  had, in 1211, suppressed a rebellion in Moray of the Thanes of
  Ross under Guthred son of Donald Ban MacWilliam whom a few years
  later he captured and beheaded,<a id="footnotetag220" name=
  "footnotetag220"></a><a href="#footnote220"><sup>3</sup></a> came
  to Moray again; and, about the 1st of August 1214, King William
  demanded, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id=
  "page95"></a>[pg 95]</span> and received<a id="footnotetag221"
  name="footnotetag221"></a><a href="#footnote221"><sup>4</sup></a>
  Earl John's daughter, whose name is not known, as a hostage for
  her father's loyalty, and a guarantee of the peace then made,
  under which John was probably recognised as earl and as entitled
  to his reduced territory. His daughter may, at this time, have
  been her father's sole heiress, although she did not remain so,
  because we find that he had a son who lived till 1226, called
  Harald. Meantime Bishop Adam, after the death in 1213 of Bishop
  John, his half-blinded and mutilated predecessor, succeeded to
  the Episcopal See of Caithness,<a id="footnotetag222" name=
  "footnotetag222"></a><a href="#footnote222"><sup>5</sup></a> and
  seems to have reversed Bishop John's policy of leniency to his
  flock by exacting from them heavier and heavier tithes, as years
  went by.</p>

  <p>In 1217, King Hakon's rival, Jarl Skuli, thought Earl John so
  promising a traitor as to send him letters forged with the Norse
  king's seal.<a id="footnotetag223" name=
  "footnotetag223"></a><a href="#footnote223"><sup>6</sup></a> In
  1218 John was present at Bergen to witness the ordeal
  successfully undergone by King Hakon's mother in order to prove
  that king, then a boy, to be her son by the late King Hakon
  Sverri's son, and so rightly entitled to the Norwegian
  crown.<a id="footnotetag224" name="footnotetag224"></a><a href=
  "#footnote224"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

  <p>After Earl John's return from Norway, the bishop's exactions
  of tithes of butter reached such a pitch that the Caithness folk
  met near his house at Halkirk, and demanded that the earl should
  protect them against the bishop's rapacity, and, either at the
  earl's suggestion or without any opposition on his part, they
  attacked the bishop in his house, which was close to
  <i>Breithivellir</i> (now Brawl) Castle, where John lived. The
  Saga gives the following description of this affair:&mdash;<a id=
  "footnotetag225" name="footnotetag225"></a><a href=
  "#footnote225"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

  <p>"They then held a Thing on the fell above the homestead where
  the earl was. Rafn the Lawman was then with the bishop, and
  prayed the bishop to spare the men; also he said he was afraid
  how things might go. Then a message was sent to Earl John with a
  prayer that he would reconcile the bishop and the freemen;
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg
  96]</span> but the earl would come never near the spot. Then the
  freemen ran down from the fell and fared hotly and eagerly. And
  when Rafn the Lawman saw that, he bade the bishop devise some
  plan to save himself. He and the bishop were drinking in a loft,
  and when the freemen came to the loft, the monk went out at the
  door; and was straightway smitten across the face, and fell down
  dead inside the loft. And when the bishop was told that, he
  answered, 'That had not happened sooner than was likely, for he
  was always making our matters worse.' Then the bishop bade Rafn
  tell the freemen that he wished to be reconciled with them. But
  when this was told to the freemen, all those among them who were
  wiser were glad to hear it. Then the bishop went out and meant to
  be reconciled. But when the worse kind of men saw that, those who
  were most mad, they seized Bishop Adam, and brought him into a
  little house and set fire to it. But the house burned so quickly
  that they who wished to save the bishop could do nothing. Thus
  Bishop Adam died, and his body was little burnt when it was
  found. Then a fitting grave was bestowed on it,<a id=
  "footnotetag226" name="footnotetag226"></a><a href=
  "#footnote226"><sup>9</sup></a> and a worthy burial. But those
  who had been the greatest friends of the bishop, then sent men to
  find the King of Scots. Alexander was then King of Scots, the son
  of King William the Saint. But when the king was ware of these
  tidings" (he took it) "so ill that men have those miseries in
  mind which he wrought after the burning of the bishop, in maiming
  of men and manslaying, and loss of goods and banishment out of
  the land."</p>

  <p>From the above account of the matter, it appears that Earl
  John, who was responsible for law and order in Caithness at the
  time, although invited by Rafn the Lawman to intervene, and
  although he was on the spot, did nothing, saying "he could give
  no advice" and "that he thought it concerned him very little,"
  and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg
  97]</span> adding that "two bad things were before them, that it
  was unbearable" and that "he could suggest no other
  choice,"<a id="footnotetag227" name="footnotetag227"></a><a href=
  "#footnote227"><sup>10</sup></a> that is, but to pay the bishop's
  tithes, however exorbitant, or not pay them, or possibly to make
  an end of him. It is clear also that the monk who was with the
  bishop was to blame for his exactions. But there is some excuse
  in the fact that Bishop John had been censured by Rome for his
  neglect in collecting the dues of Rome or Peter's Pence as
  greatly as Bishop Adam was blamed by the people of Caithness for
  his greediness. There is no need to brand Bishop Adam as a
  voluptuary for excessive drinking and immorality.<a id=
  "footnotetag228" name="footnotetag228"></a><a href=
  "#footnote228"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

  <p>These events took place in 1222, and King Alexander, urged by
  the remainder of the bishops in Scotland, at once marched into
  Caithness with an army, and took vengeance on the bishop's
  murderers by mutilating a large number of those concerned and
  seizing their lands,<a id="footnotetag229" name=
  "footnotetag229"></a><a href="#footnote229"><sup>12</sup></a>
  while in 1223 the Pope excommunicated them and also interdicted
  them from their lands.</p>

  <p>The Annals of Dunstable, however, paint Earl John in much
  blacker colours, and state that he himself caused the bishop, who
  was escaping from the fire, to be cast into it again, and the
  bodies of two others previously slain, his nephew and the monk,
  to be thrown upon him, and that King Alexander forfeited half
  John's earldom.<a id="footnotetag230" name=
  "footnotetag230"></a><a href="#footnote230"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

  <p>The Saga says that the king forfeited Earl John's lands for
  the murder of the bishop. Wyntoun, however, states that
  afterwards, at Christmas festivities at Forfar,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p> "Thare borwyd that erle than his land</p>

      <p> That lay unto the Kyngis hand</p>

      <p> As yhe before herd, peryst wes."<a id="footnotetag231"
      name="footnotetag231"></a><a href=
      "#footnote231"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>By this "borrowing," however, Earl John recovered <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg 98]</span> only
  the reduced earldom above described, that is without the Lordship
  of Sutherland, to which William de Moravia, Hugo's son, had
  succeeded between 1211 and 1214, and without that south-western
  portion of it, which, as stated, had been given to Gilbert de
  Moravia by Hugo in 1211, and without the Moddan family's lands
  near Loch Coire and in Strathnaver and Caithness, and without
  Harald Ungi's moiety or half share of the Caithness earldom; and,
  as already stated, the lands appertaining to this share were
  probably occupied by his family as represented by Gunni and
  Ragnhild, Eric Stagbrellir's youngest daughter, and by the
  members of the Moddan clan, and the retainers of the Erlend
  line.</p>

  <p>In 1223, Earl John was again at Bergen, with Bishop Bjarni of
  Orkney and others, to consider the rival claims of King Hakon and
  Jarl Skuli to the Norse crown,<a id="footnotetag232" name=
  "footnotetag232"></a><a href="#footnote232"><sup>15</sup></a> and
  in 1224 he went thither again to leave his only son, Harald, as a
  hostage for his own loyalty.<a id="footnotetag233" name=
  "footnotetag233"></a><a href="#footnote233"><sup>16</sup></a> In
  1226, Harald was drowned at sea, probably on his return voyage,
  thus leaving John without any male heir, and save for his
  nameless hostage daughter or her children, if any, without any
  direct lineal heirs for the jarldom and earldom of Orkney and of
  Caithness respectively.</p>

  <p>In 1228 John sent presents to the Norse king, and received in
  return a good long-ship and many other gifts; and in 1230 John is
  found aiding Olaf, King of Man, a friend of the Norse king, by
  giving him a like vessel, "The Ox," to enable him to complete his
  voyage back from Norway to his own kingdom, and in the same year
  John rendered assistance to the Norse expedition, which had
  attacked the South Hebrides, by harbouring its ships in Orkney on
  their voyage back to Norway.<a id="footnotetag234" name=
  "footnotetag234"></a><a href="#footnote234"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

  <p>From the above facts it is clear that Earl John, though he
  owed allegiance to both kings, was more <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg 99]</span>
  inclined to favour Norway than Scotland, and that he was more
  constantly in attendance at the Norse, than at the Scottish
  Court. At the same time it became more and more likely that he
  would have to choose between his two masters, as war for the
  Sudreyar or Hebrides was already certain to break out between the
  two countries, and, save for civil war in Norway, would have
  broken out at once.</p>

  <p>Snaekoll<a id="footnotetag235" name=
  "footnotetag235"></a><a href="#footnote235"><sup>18</sup></a>
  Gunni's son, as the sole male representative of the Erlend
  Thorfinnson, St. Magnus, St. Ragnvald, Eric Stagbrellir and
  Harald Ungi line remaining in Scotland, who had probably about
  this time succeeded, or at least was recognised as next heir to
  the Moddan family estates in Strathnaver and Caithness,
  approached Earl John in 1231, and demanded from him Jarl
  Ragnvald's lands in Orkney. But the earl, who held Orkney in its
  entirety as the representative of the line of Paul and of Harold
  Maddadson, who had seized it when Jarl St. Ragnvald died in 1158,
  refused to give Snaekoll any part of those lands; and Snaekoll,
  failing to obtain any redress, sought the aid of Hanef, formerly
  a page, but now Commissioner in Orkney, of the Norse King, and
  demanded his help in recovering his lands there. Snaekoll and
  Hanef with a large following accordingly crossed the Pentland
  Firth to Thurso to enforce the claim, but the earl again angrily
  refused to restore the lands in Orkney, and it would seem that he
  was also unwilling to let Snaekoll have his rights in
  Caithness.<a id="footnotetag236" name=
  "footnotetag236"></a><a href="#footnote236"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

  <p>Each party occupied separate lodgings in Thurso with their
  separate followings, and Hanef and his friends, warned by a
  messenger of the earl's reported design of killing them,
  forestalled it by attacking the earl first, and they slew him
  with nine wounds in the cellar of his lodgings. After the affray
  they crossed over to Orkney, where they fortified the small but
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg
  100]</span> massive castle<a id="footnotetag237" name=
  "footnotetag237"></a><a href="#footnote237"><sup>20</sup></a> or
  tower of Kolbein Hruga or Cobbie Row, in the Island of Vigr or
  Wyre, now called Veira, near Rousay in Orkney, and provisioned it
  for a siege, which lasted the whole winter, and was raised only
  after both sides had come to an agreement that all questions
  arising out of the earl's death at Thurso, should be referred,
  not to the Scottish courts, but to the Norse king, Hakon, in
  Bergen.</p>

  <p>Both parties, with their witnesses, accordingly crossed the
  North Sea in 1232, and Hakon heard the case, and punished the
  partisans of Snaekoll, some with death and others with
  imprisonment. Snaekoll himself, who, as the heir of Jarl
  Ragnvald, was too valuable a pawn to be sacrificed, was retained,
  and lived long in Norway with Earl Skuli, and afterwards with
  King Hakon.<a id="footnotetag238" name=
  "footnotetag238"></a><a href="#footnote238"><sup>21</sup></a> It
  is noteworthy that a <i>gaedinga</i> ship (no Jewish Ship,<a id=
  "footnotetag239" name="footnotetag239"></a><a href=
  "#footnote239"><sup>22</sup></a> as Torfaeus states, but a ship
  of the <i>gaedingar</i> or <i>lendirmen</i> of the Earl of
  Orkney) was, on the return voyage, lost at sea; and, bearing in
  mind the large number of Orkney notables who had been slain at
  the battle of Floruvagr in Norway in 1194, men of means and
  standing must have been scarce in Orkney for long after this
  time.</p>

  <p>There is a tradition mentioned by Alexander Pope of
  Reay,<a id="footnotetag240" name="footnotetag240"></a><a href=
  "#footnote240"><sup>23</sup></a> the translator of the
  <i>Orcades</i> of Torfaeus, that Snaekoll, being deprived of his
  rights in Orkney by King Hakon, returned late in life to
  Caithness, where the Norse King could not deprive him of
  anything, and lived in that county at Ulbster. If so, why did he
  return?</p>

  <p>The answer brings us to a mysterious lady, who is known to us
  through a charter<a id="footnotetag241" name=
  "footnotetag241"></a><a href="#footnote241"><sup>24</sup></a> of
  May 1269 preserved in the <i>Registrum Episcopatus
  Moraviensis</i> or Chartulary of the Bishopric of Moray, and who
  is called therein <i>nobilis mulier domina Johanna</i>, the then
  deceased wife of Freskin de Moravia, Lord of Duffus, who had died
  before her. From her name of Johanna <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg 101]</span> this
  lady is stated to have been a daughter of Earl John, amongst
  others by so eminent an authority as the late Mr. William F.
  Skene in a paper "on the Earldom of Caithness," first read to the
  Society of Antiquaries of Scotland on the 11th March 1878, which
  is reprinted as Appendix V to the Third Volume of his <i>Celtic
  Scotland</i> at pages 448 to 453, and the lady is generally known
  as Lady Johanna de Strathnavir; and on her descent much
  subsequent history depends.</p>

  <p>Skene's conclusion is that the half of Caithness which
  afterwards belonged to the Angus earls was that half usually
  possessed by the line of Erlend Thorfinnson, and that Joanna (or
  Johanna) was Earl John's daughter, and, as such, inherited the
  Paul share of the earldom and brought it to Freskin de Moravia,
  when he married her, without the title.</p>

  <p>We doubt the accuracy of this conclusion, for reasons which,
  however, rest not on direct evidence, but, like those given in
  Mr. Skene's paper, on mere probabilities; and we hold that the
  converse is true, and that Johanna was no daughter of John, and
  that it was the Erlend half of the Caithness earldom lands that
  went to her and her husband Freskin de Moravia of Duffus, while
  the moiety of Paul, in our opinion, remained with a nameless
  daughter of John, and went along with the title of Earl of
  Caithness, to her husband Magnus, and so to the Angus earls of
  Caithness, though the lands which went with it were then much
  curtailed in extent.</p>

  <p>But it must be remembered that, in the absence of records, any
  solution of this difficult problem at present rests on mere
  speculation and guesswork, and the opinions expressed here must
  be accepted as mere conjectures unsupported by direct
  contemporary evidence, and based only upon reasonable
  probability.</p>

  <p>We propose to attempt to deal with this difficult subject in
  the next chapter.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id=

  <h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

  <h3>The Succession to the Caithness Earldom.</h3>

  <p>After the death of Earl John in 1231, we come to a most
  perplexing time, and it is almost impossible to discover a way
  out of the maze of genealogical difficulties in which we find
  ourselves involved. Not only is there no chronicle of the period,
  but there are hardly any records at all to help us. The pedigree
  of the descendants of Earl Harold Maddadson, and particularly of
  his daughters, who are named in the <i>Orkneyinga Saga</i>,
  ceases;<a id="footnotetag242" name="footnotetag242"></a><a href=
  "#footnote242"><sup>1</sup></a> and that of Earl John's family
  and of Harald Ungi and his sisters downwards stops also, save in
  the case of Ragnhild, the youngest of them, whose son Snaekoll
  Gunni's son is mentioned as claimant in 1231 from Earl John of
  certain lands in Orkney and in Caithness as well.</p>

  <p>Attempts to clear up the mystery have been made,<a id=
  "footnotetag243" name="footnotetag243"></a><a href=
  "#footnote243"><sup>2</sup></a> but none of them have resulted in
  any certain or trustworthy conclusions. Nor can anyone now expect
  to fare much better; for not only are authentic pedigrees of the
  Caithness earls and the materials for framing them undiscovered
  or non-existent, but yet another pedigree, namely that of the
  Angus line, which provided, from its male members, successors to
  the title and to a moiety of the Caithness earldom, is very
  obscure.</p>

  <p>This chapter, therefore, is largely conjectural, and must be
  accepted as such. It deserves, and will doubtless receive, severe
  criticism.</p>

  <p>So far as the Angus pedigree can be ascertained, it appears
  that Earl Gillebride died about 1187, leaving two sons, Adam and
  Gilchrist, who succeeded in turn to that earldom, and Gillebride
  also left a third <span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id=
  "page103"></a>[pg 103]</span> son, Gilbert,<a id="footnotetag244"
  name="footnotetag244"></a><a href="#footnote244"><sup>3</sup></a>
  a fourth, William, and a fifth, Angus, who had a son Gillebert or
  Gillebryd. Gilchrist died about 1204, leaving an eldest son,
  Duncan, Earl of Angus, and another son called Magnus, by his two
  wives respectively, his second wife, from the name of Magnus
  given to her eldest son and to many subsequent earls of that
  son's line, being assumed with considerable probability to have
  been, not a sister of Earl John, but a sister of Harald Ungi,
  either Ingibiorg or Elin. Duncan died about 1214, and left a son,
  Malcolm, Earl of Angus, whose sole heiress was a daughter,
  Matilda, who, about 1240, married, first, John Comyn, who was
  killed in France shortly after the marriage, without leaving
  issue to inherit. As her second husband, Matilda, Countess of
  Angus married Gilbert d'Umphraville, Lord of Prudhoe and
  Redesdale in Northumberland in 1243; and their son, also named
  Gilbert d'Umphraville, was born about 1244, and succeeded his
  father as Earl of Angus in 1267, and though both these Gilberts
  became successively Earls of Angus,<a id="footnotetag245" name=
  "footnotetag245"></a><a href="#footnote245"><sup>4</sup></a>
  neither of them ever became Earl of Orkney. Robertson's
  contention in his <i>Early Kings of Scotland</i>, (vol. II, p. 23
  note) that they were grafted on the wrong pedigree seems
  justified by the discrepancy in dates; for the Icelandic Annals
  give only one Gibbon who died in 1256, and we know that Magnus
  III was earl in 1263 and till 1273. Indeed little confidence can
  be reposed in the Diploma of the Orkney Earls, the only authority
  for the existence of two Orkney Earls called Gilbert, and in the
  period covered by the <i>Orkneyinga Saga</i>, we can prove many
  errors in the Diploma.</p>

  <p>Of Magnus son of Gilchrist, Earl of Angus, we know something.
  He was alive in 1227, when he attested the record of the
  perambulation of the boundaries of the lands of the Abbey of
  Aberbrothock,<a id="footnotetag246" name=
  "footnotetag246"></a><a href="#footnote246"><sup>5</sup></a> and
  in the List of the Oliphant family charters dated 1594 in the
  Register House in Edinburgh there is an <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg 104]</span>
  entry of "Ane charter under the Great Seill made be Alexr to
  Magnus sone to Gylcryst sometime Earle of Angus of the Erledome
  of South Caithness" which included Berridale and lands which
  Magnus' granddaughter's great-grandson Malise II conveyed to
  Reginald Chen III, known as "Morar na Shein," after 1340.</p>

  <p>It has been suggested that after Earl John's death in 1231,
  the successor to the earldom of Caithness was a minor, which Earl
  Gilchrist's son, Magnus, could not have been in 1231, and that
  this minor and ward was a son of Magnus, and bore the same name
  as his father.</p>

  <p>The wardship seems at first sight to be proved in Robertson's
  <i>Early Kings</i>,<a id="footnotetag247" name=
  "footnotetag247"></a><a href="#footnote247"><sup>6</sup></a> and
  the proof is to the following effect:&mdash;Malcolm of Angus
  attested a charter in Earl John's lifetime on 22nd April 1231,
  using his own title of "Angus" only. After John's death, Malcolm
  attested another charter on 7th October 1232 as "M. Comite de
  Anegus et Katania,"<a id="footnotetag248" name=
  "footnotetag248"></a><a href="#footnote248"><sup>7</sup></a>
  using, in addition to his own title of Angus, as was customary,
  the title of a ward, who was heir to another earldom, in this
  case that of Caithness. But on 3rd July 1236, Malcolm Earl of
  Angus, who lived till 1237 if not longer, attested a third
  charter using his own title of "Angus" only, without the addition
  "and of Caithness." These facts can be explained by his ward's
  having attained his majority and entered upon his earldom of
  Caithness between 7th October 1232 and 3rd July 1236. They cannot
  be explained by saying that "M" was not Malcolm, but Magnus, and
  that "M" stands for Gilchrist's son Magnus, who had become Earl
  of Caithness. For there was no "M. Comes de Angus" at the time
  save Malcolm, and Malcolm was therefore for about four years Earl
  of Caithness as well as of Angus.</p>

  <p>Robertson's explanation is that Malcolm was Earl <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg 105]</span> of
  Caithness only as guardian of a ward entitled to that earldom.
  The question then arises, as Robertson puts it, "who was the
  heir?" and he answers it, "certainly not his<a id=
  "footnotetag249" name="footnotetag249"></a><a href=
  "#footnote249"><sup>8</sup></a> uncle Magnus, son of
  Gillebride,<a id="footnotetag250" name=
  "footnotetag250"></a><a href="#footnote250"><sup>9</sup></a> but
  very probably the son of Magnus by Earl John's daughter; the
  supposed grant of the Earldom to this Magnus being probably
  grounded upon his real marriage with the heiress," and he adds
  "If, on the death of Earl John in 1231, his grandson was an
  orphan and a minor, his wardship would naturally have been
  granted to the next of kin, his cousin the Earl of Angus."</p>

  <p>One further charter has to be dealt with. In <i>Reg. Hon. de
  Morton</i>, vol. I, p. xxxv, cited in <i>Origines Parochiales</i>
  vol. II, p. 805, a grant by King Alexander II, to Patrick Earl of
  Dunbar dated 7th July 1235 is attested by a witness, whose name
  or initial is illegible, but who is styled ... <i>Earl</i> ...
  <i>Katanay</i>, ... <i>Comite</i> ... <i>Katanay</i>, and a
  confident opinion is expressed in a note to the citation that the
  witness was Magnus, Earl of Caithness. Now, Earl John's daughter
  was taken as a hostage on August 1, 1214, and, if she was then
  marriageable and was married at once, her eldest child could have
  been born about May 1215, and would attain twenty-one about May
  1236, but to suppose her son of the name of Magnus to have been
  the ward for whom the Earldom of Caithness was being kept till
  7th July 1235 from 1232 and that he had become Earl of Caithness
  on the 7th July 1235 seems impossible. If the blank should be
  filled up with "de Anegus et," then Malcolm Earl of Angus must
  still have been the guardian, and the ward's father and mother
  must both have been dead by 7th October 1232. This involves three
  unproved assumptions, of two unrecorded deaths and one unrecorded
  birth.</p>

  <p>On the whole, therefore, we believe that there is another and
  simpler explanation, and it seems probable <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg 106]</span> that
  there was in this case no wardship, or if there was, that there
  was a great deal more, and that Malcolm held the earldom of
  Caithness as <i>Custos</i> or administrator or trustee for the
  Crown for four years after Earl John's death till the succession
  was settled, and till all Caithness except Sutherland was
  parcelled out among three claimants, namely the two heirs, each
  of one of two sisters of Harald Ungi, and the hostage daughter of
  Earl John.</p>

  <p>When all this was settled, Magnus, as the son of one of the
  two elder sisters of Harald Ungi, and also as the husband of Earl
  John's daughter, would be entitled on Earl John's death, <i>jure
  maritae</i>, in Orkney, to a grant from the Norse king of the
  Orkney jarldom, and also, in Caithness, <i>first, jure
  maritae</i>, to a grant from the Scottish king in or after 3rd
  July 1236, of the North Caithness earldom and lands held by Earl
  John, which Dalrymple in his Collections (p. lxxiii) states
  positively, without quoting his authority, that Magnus had for a
  payment of &pound;10 per annum, and, <i>secondly, jure matris</i>
  (Ingibiorg or Elin) to a grant, also from the Scottish king, of
  the earldom of South Caithness, which by the Charter of Alexander
  "under the greit Seill," above alluded to, Magnus also got.</p>

  <p>The other moiety of the Caithness earldom lands would be
  fairly given to Johanna as heiress of Ragnhild, Harald Ungi's
  youngest sister, and we know that Johanna got that other moiety,
  because we find that her descendants inherited it, and conveyed
  it or parts of it by writs still extant, by the description of
  "half Caithness."</p>

  <p>There are, however, other views. Skene's opinion on the
  subject of the succession, in his very able paper (given in
  Appendix V, vol. iii, pp. 449-50 of his <i>Celtic Scotland</i>),
  is as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Earl Harald died in 1206, and was succeeded by <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg 107]</span> his
  son David, who died in 1214, when his brother John became Earl of
  Orkney and Caithness. Fordun tells us that King William made a
  treaty of peace with him in that year, and took his daughter as a
  hostage, but the burning of Bishop Adam in 1222 brought King
  Alexander II down upon Earl John, who was obliged to give up part
  of his lands into the hands of the king, which, however, he
  redeemed the following year by paying a large sum of money, and
  by his death in 1231 the line of Paul again came to an end.</p>

  <p>"In 1232, we find Magnus, son of Gillebride, Earl of Angus,
  called Earl of Caithness, and the earldom remained in this family
  till between 1320 and 1329, when Magnus Earl of Orkney and
  Caithness, died; but during this time it is clear that these
  earls only possessed one half of Caithness and the other half
  appears in the possession of the De Moravia family, for Freskin,
  Lord of Duffus, who married Johanna, who possessed Strathnaver in
  her own right, and died before 1269, had two daughters, Mary,
  married to Sir Reginald Cheyne, and Christian, married to William
  de Fedrett; and each of these daughters had one fourth part of
  Caithness, for William de Fedrett resigns<a id="footnotetag252"
  name="footnotetag252"></a><a href=
  "#footnote252"><sup>11</sup></a> his fourth to Sir Reginald
  Cheyne,<a id="footnotetag253" name="footnotetag253"></a><a href=
  "#footnote253"><sup>12</sup></a> who then appears in possession
  of one-half of Caithness (Chart. of Moray; Robertson's Index).
  These daughters probably inherited the half of Caithness through
  their mother Johanna. Gillebride<a id="footnotetag254" name=
  "footnotetag254"></a><a href="#footnote254"><sup>13</sup></a>
  having called one of his sons by the Norwegian name of Magnus,
  indicates that he had a Norwegian mother. This is clear from his
  also becoming Earl of Orkney, which the king of Scots could not
  have given him. Gillebride died in<a id="footnotetag255" name=
  "footnotetag255"></a><a href="#footnote255"><sup>14</sup></a>
  1200, so that Magnus must have been born before that date, and
  about the time of Earl Harald Ungi, who had half of Caithness,
  and died in 1198. Magnus is a name peculiar to this line, as the
  great Earl Magnus belonged to it, and Harald Ungi had a brother
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg
  108]</span> Magnus. The probability is that the half of Caithness
  which belonged to the Angus family was that half usually
  possessed by the earls of the line of Erlend,<a id=
  "footnotetag256" name="footnotetag256"></a><a href=
  "#footnote256"><sup>15</sup></a> and was given by King Alexander
  with the title of Earl to Magnus, as the son of one of Earl
  Harald Ungi's sisters, while Johanna, through whom the Moray
  family inherited the other half, was, as indicated by her name,
  the daughter of John, Earl of Caithness of the line of Paul, who
  had been kept by the king as a hostage, and given in marriage to
  Freskin de Moravia."</p>

  <p>Sir William Fraser<a id="footnotetag257" name=
  "footnotetag257"></a><a href="#footnote257"><sup>16</sup></a> in
  a note to the <i>Sutherland Book</i>&mdash;a mere <i>obiter
  dictum</i>, however&mdash;doubts Skene's suggestions "that
  Johanna, Lady of Strathnaver, who married Freskin de Moravia,
  Lord of Duffus, about 1240, was the daughter of John Haraldson,"
  that is Earl John, and that "Magnus of Angus was the son of a
  sister of a former Earl of Caithness," and states that "Skene's
  arguments are plausible, but there is no very good evidence in
  support of them." Skene's argument rests mainly on the names
  "Johanna" and "Magnus," by itself an insecure foundation, and one
  which it is hoped to explain or remove, adopting the argument
  from "Magnus," a name which constantly recurs, and rejecting the
  argument from "Johanna," a name which never again appears, in
  this family.</p>

  <p>A century or more after the death in 1231 of Earl John, we
  find Reginald Chen III, known as Morar na Shein or "Lord" Schen,
  in possession of a moiety of the Caithness earldom, without the
  title, and living in Latheron and Halkirk parishes, while the
  other moiety was held by the Caithness Earls of the line of
  Angus, and in 1340 we find Reginald More, Chamberlain of
  Scotland, ancestor of the Crichton or Sinclair Earls of
  Caithness, acquiring from Malise II, one of the Stratherne Earls
  of Caithness and a descendant of the line of Paul and also of the
  line of Erlend, part of south Caithness (including Berridale),
  which therefore Reginald <span class="pagenum"><a name="page109"
  id="page109"></a>[pg 109]</span> Chen III did not then own or
  acquire, though he owned half Caithness. But Reginald Chen III
  did acquire Berridale and other lands later in David II's reign
  according to <i>Origines Parochiales</i>, II, p. 764.</p>

  <p>Now it is known from other sources that Reginald Chen III was
  a grandson of Johanna of Strathnaver, the mysterious lady of
  unrecorded parentage already referred to, who owned land in
  "Strathnauir," and who was dead in 1269, and who had married, at
  a date which we hope to fix, Freskin de Moravia, Lord of Duffus,
  then also dead, and had had by him two daughters, Mary and
  Christian, who were married respectively to Reginald Chen II and
  William de Federeth I (whose sons respectively were Reginald Chen
  III and William de Federeth II) and these ladies succeeded each
  to one fourth of Caithness; and a grant,<a id="footnotetag258"
  name="footnotetag258"></a><a href=
  "#footnote258"><sup>17</sup></a> which was made in David II's
  time by William de Federeth II in favour of Reginald Chen III,
  placed him in possession of William de Federeth II's quarter of
  Caithness. Reginald Chen III thus had all the half share of
  Caithness which was held by his grandmother, Johanna of
  Strathnaver. We also know that by another grant in 1286<a id=
  "footnotetag259" name="footnotetag259"></a><a href=
  "#footnote259"><sup>18</sup></a> William de Federeth I had
  already conveyed to Reginald Chen II four davachs of land in
  Strathnaver and all his other lands there; and, besides these
  grants, we have authentic record in May 1269, which recites that
  Lady Johanna had before that date granted a considerable part of
  her lands in Strathnaver to the Bishop of Moray for the
  maintenance of two chaplains to minister in the Cathedral of
  Elgin.</p>

  <p>By the above record, which is a regrant of the Strathnaver
  lands by Archebald Bishop of Moray in May 1269 to Reginald Chen
  II, not only is his marriage before that date to Mary daughter of
  Johanna by Freskin de Moravia proved, but the lands in
  Strathnaver are identifiable. They were "Langeval and Rossewal,
  tofftys de Dovyr, Achenedess, Clibr', <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg 110]</span>
  Ardovyr and Cornefern," which now are known in part as Langdale,
  Rossal, Achness, Clibreck and Coire-na-fearn, while "tofftys" are
  "tofts," and "Dovyr" and "Ardovyr" are respectively old Gaelic
  for "water" and for "upper water." "Dovyr" would denote the River
  Naver and loch of that name, and "Ardovyr" would mean Loch Coire
  and the Mallard River, that is the "Abhain 'a Mhail Aird" of the
  Ordnance Map (whatever that may mean),<a id="footnotetag260"
  name="footnotetag260"></a><a href=
  "#footnote260"><sup>19</sup></a> which rises in Loch Coire, and,
  after a course of six miles from its upper valley, falls about
  330 feet below its source into the River Naver at Dalharrold.
  These lands of the Lady Johanna lay partly to the south of Loch
  Naver, extended southwards nearly to Ben Armine, and stretched
  westwards to Loch Vellich or Bealach and the Crask and Mudale,
  eastwards to Loch Truderscaig, and northwards down the valley of
  the Naver at least as far as Syre. Part of them, close to
  Achness,<a id="footnotetag261" name="footnotetag261"></a><a href=
  "#footnote162"><sup>20</sup></a> is to this day known locally as
  Kerrow-na-Shein, or Chen's Quarter, either after Johanna's
  son-in-law, Sir Reginald Chen II, or after her grandson of the
  same name, the great "Morar na Shein," about whom so many legends
  still survive in Cat. These lands in Strathnaver are roughly
  hatched on the map of Cat in this volume, and, as she gave them
  away in charitable trust, they probably formed only a small part
  of her whole estate after her marriage with Freskin de Moravia,
  which probably comprised the old Parish of Farr, now divided into
  Tongue, Farr, and Reay.</p>

  <p>It is suggested that the ownership of these lands in
  Strathnaver and of the other upland territories in Halkirk and
  Latheron parishes, held by her descendants and sequels in all her
  estate, the Chens, connects the Lady Johanna with the family of
  Moddan "in dale" in Caithness and with Earl Ottar, and with
  Frakark and Audhild her niece, and that Johanna was entitled to
  these lands in their entirety in her own right as <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg 111]</span> the
  sole descendant remaining in Scotland after 1232 of Harald Ungi's
  younger surviving sister Ragnhild, possibly through her son
  Snaekoll by Gunni, and that Snaekoll was next heir to these lands
  before he went abroad, and either that he was Johanna's father,
  or that she became Ragnhild's heir in his place. In this way
  Johanna would have a good right, especially if Magnus, son of
  Gilchrist, had been compensated for his mother's share by
  receiving a grant of South Caithness and its earldom, to receive
  a grant of the rest of the Harald Ungi half share of the
  Caithness earldom, lands previously held by Jarls and Earls St.
  Magnus and Erlend Thorfinn's son or some lands of equal value,
  and the reason why she had such very large estates as those which
  she brought to her husband and the Chen family as their
  successors would be made clear. For she would have completed her
  title to a large share of the Erlend lands, and also to the
  Moddan lands which Gunni and Ragnhild had entered upon and held
  after the elder sister of Ragnhild had left Caithness on her
  marriage with Gilchrist Earl of Angus.</p>

  <p>In support of Johanna's title it is to be observed that
  neither Magnus II, nor his wife, is recorded to have claimed any
  part of the Strathnaver lands, a fact which indicates that
  Johanna and her predecessors had acquired an independent title to
  them, and that, too, a title not derived through Earl John.
  Again, (though in a time when records fail us, the argument
  proves little) Johanna, although from her probable date she might
  have been so, is not recorded to have been a daughter of John.
  Further, to be of suitable age<a id="footnotetag262" name=
  "footnotetag262"></a><a href="#footnote262"><sup>21</sup></a> to
  marry Freskin she must have been born long after any known child
  of Earl John, even his son Harald who had died in 1226. Lastly,
  neither Johanna nor her husband Freskin nor any descendant of
  hers ever claimed either the whole of or any share in the Orkney
  jarldom,<a id="footnotetag263" name="footnotetag263"></a><a href=
  "#footnote263"><sup>22</sup></a> which Earls Harald Maddadson,
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg
  112]</span> David and John had held in its entirety, and to which
  Johanna, had she been Earl John's only daughter, or her husband
  Freskin would have been entitled to claim to succeed as sole
  heir; while if John had had two daughters, and Johanna had been
  one of them, she or her husband Freskin would have been entitled
  to claim a grant of some share at least of the lands appertaining
  to the Orkney jarldom.</p>

  <p>It was, however, Earl Magnus who made such claims, and with
  success, and he may well have obtained the Orkney jarldom and
  lands, and part of the Caithness earldom as well, with the title,
  not only as being the son of the elder of Harald Ungi's sisters,
  but as the husband of Earl John's nameless daughter, while his
  name of Magnus, afterwards so often repeated in the Angus line,
  came into that line obviously through his mother at his baptism,
  and not through his wife at his marriage.</p>

  <p>The name of Johanna, on which Skene mainly founds his
  assertion that Johanna of Strathnaver was Earl John's daughter,
  is just as easily explicable, and with equal verisimilitude, if
  she was not. Snaekoll went to Norway in 1232, leaving behind him,
  on our hypothesis, one child, an infant daughter of tender years,
  or possibly as yet unborn. The child of a younger child of
  Ragnhild would probably be still younger. Heiress to very large
  landed estates and justly entitled to claim a moiety of the
  Erlend Thorfinnson half of Caithness and all the Moddan
  territories, this child would be made by the king of Scotland a
  ward, to be married, if female, in due course to a suitable
  husband. The Queen of Scotland, who in 1232 had been childless
  for eleven years and never had any children afterwards, was an
  English princess who was married to Alexander II on 19th June
  1221, and lived till 4th March 1237-8, a period which would cover
  all Johanna's early years. The queen's name was <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg 113]</span>
  Joanna, and Johanna of Strathnaver may have been called after
  her, as Earl John had possibly been called after her father King
  John of England, the friend of Earl John's father, Harold
  Maddadson.</p>

  <p>We now have to fix the date of Freskin de Moravia, nephew of
  William, <i>dominus Sutherlandiae</i> since about 1214. Freskin,
  as stated, was undoubtedly the husband of Johanna of Strathnaver,
  and became on his marriage owner of her lands there as well as of
  a moiety of the Caithness earldom lands.</p>

  <p>Freskin was, as also stated, the eldest son of Walter de
  Moravia of Duffus, second son of Hugo Freskyn of Strabrock,
  Duffus and Sutherland by Walter's marriage with Euphamia,
  probably, from her name, a daughter of Ferchar Mac-in-tagart, who
  became Earl of Ross.<a id="footnotetag264" name=
  "footnotetag264"></a><a href="#footnote264"><sup>23</sup></a> As
  Ferchar granted<a id="footnotetag265" name=
  "footnotetag265"></a><a href="#footnote265"><sup>24</sup></a>
  certain lands at Clon in Ross about the year 1224 to Freskin's
  father Walter de Moravia of Duffus without pecuniary or other
  valuable consideration, it has been concluded, probably
  correctly, that this grant was made on the occasion of the
  marriage of Walter to Ferchar's daughter Euphamia; and Freskin,
  their heir, was born in or after 1225, and had become
  <i>dominus</i> de Duffus by 1248 on his father's death. Johanna,
  on our hypothesis, would have to be born by 1232 at latest, that
  is, before or soon after her supposed father Snaekoll went to
  Norway, and from her supposed father's date she could hardly have
  been born before 1225. Snaekoll's date can be ascertained with
  comparative accuracy. For his mother lost her first husband,
  Lifolf Baldpate, only in 1198, at the battle of Clairdon, and she
  can hardly have married Snaekoll's father, Gunni, much before
  1200. From these dates Snaekoll could have been born by 1201, and
  married in Scotland between 1224 and 1231, and Freskin and
  Johanna would thus be of very suitable ages to marry each other,
  and their marriage therefore would take place after 1245, or
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg
  114]</span> possibly as late as 1250. If Johanna was the daughter
  of a younger child of Ragnhild, she might be born later than
  1225.</p>

  <p>This would involve a long minority for Johanna, and by reason
  of her marriage with Freskin de Moravia in 1245 or later, we
  suspect that Freskin's uncle, William <i>dominus
  Sutherlandiae</i>, whose territories were bounded on the north
  and east by her lands, was her guardian, an office whose duties
  the head of the powerful and loyal House of Sutherland alone
  could efficiently perform in the troublous and turbulent times of
  her minority.</p>

  <p>From Bain's <i>Calendar of Documents</i> relating to
  Scotland<a id="footnotetag266" name="footnotetag266"></a><a href=
  "#footnote266"><sup>25</sup></a> we know that Freskin was one of
  the signatories of the National Bond of mutual alliance and
  friendship with Sir Llewelin son of Griffin, Prince of Wales, and
  other leading Welshmen on the 18th of March 1259. Freskin would
  not have been asked to sign a document of such international
  importance unless, like another of its signatories, Sir Reginald
  Chen I (whose son of the same name, Reginald Chen II, married
  Freskin's daughter, Mary of Duffus, later on) he had been one of
  the leading men of his time in Scotland. We also find that his
  rights were saved in a charter of 11th April 1260 and that on
  13th October 1260 he was one of the three vice-gerents of
  Alexander Comyn, Earl of Buchan, Justiciar of Scotland, present
  in Court at Perth on that date.<a id="footnotetag267" name=
  "footnotetag267"></a><a href="#footnote267"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

  <p>On the 16th March 1262-3 from a grant of two chaplains<a id=
  "footnotetag268" name="footnotetag268"></a><a href=
  "#footnote268"><sup>27</sup></a> for the weal of the soul of the
  deceased Freskin of Moray, Lord of Duffus, we know that he had
  died before that date, that is, probably before his fortieth
  year. Freskin, then, died after 13th October 1260 and before 16th
  March 1262-3, and was buried in the chapel of St. Lawrence in the
  Church of Duffus, which he had founded and endowed with lands at
  Dawey in Strath Spey, and Duffus. His wife Johanna <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg 115]</span>
  ("quondam sponsa" "quondam Friskyni de Moravia") was certainly
  dead in May 1269 (Reg. Morav., ch. 126, p. 139).</p>

  <p>They left no male heir, but they left two daughters, Mary and
  Christian, both minors at their father's death and probably too
  young to have been married in August 1263, when, as we shall
  find, their lands and their half share of the Caithness earldom
  sadly needed defenders from Norse invaders.</p>

  <p>Owing to subsequent additions of territory, it is impossible
  at the present time to say exactly what all the lands owned by an
  independent title by Lady Johanna of Strathnaver were, but some
  guidance towards the further identification of her lands in
  Caithness is found in the fact that later charters give the names
  of the lands which her sequel in all her estate, Reginald Chen
  III, known as "Lord Schein" or "Morar na Shein" held,<a id=
  "footnotetag269" name="footnotetag269"></a><a href=
  "#footnote269"><sup>28</sup></a> and that he lived in and hunted
  from a castle at the exit of the river Thurso from Loch More
  above Dirlot or Dilred in Strathmore in Halkirk parish, but never
  owned Brawl, a capital residence of the Caithness earls, but did
  own to the end of his life "half Caithness," and acquired South
  Caithness after 1340 by purchase. Adding to this the facts,
  indications, and probabilities alluded to in this and preceding
  chapters as to the position of lands in Caithness variously
  owned, we are able to venture to come to a general conclusion as
  to the devolution of the Caithness earldom and lands.</p>

  <p>This conclusion is, that what may be termed the shares of the
  respective lines of Paul and Erlend, the sons of Earl Thorfinn
  and others, in the Caithness earldom lands probably went
  respectively between 1231 and 1239 and afterwards in the
  following manner.</p>

  <p>The right to succeed to the share of Paul passed, on his
  descendant Earl John's death in 1231, to Earl <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg 116]</span>
  John's only child then alive, the nameless hostage daughter, who,
  according to our theory, had after 1st August 1214 married
  Magnus, son of Earl Gilchrist of Angus by his second marriage
  with either Ingibiorg or Elin, both sisters of Harald Ungi, and
  both older than Ragnhild. But the title of Earl of Caithness and
  the enjoyment of the whole earldom was on Earl John's death
  temporarily conferred, in addition to his title of Earl of Angus,
  on Malcolm, Earl of Angus, and nephew of Magnus the husband of
  John's hostage daughter, as being the head of the Angus family
  and one of the most powerful earls in Scotland, pending a general
  settlement of the affairs of Sutherland and Caithness; and
  Malcolm held his own Earldom of Angus, and, in addition, for the
  Crown, as <i>Custos</i>, trustee, or administrator <i>pendente
  lite</i>, held Caithness after 22nd April 1231 and certainly at
  7th October 1232, possibly till 3rd July 1236, when the following
  settlement was made.</p>

  <p>Caithness, without Sutherland, was with the title of Earl of
  Caithness, North and South, confirmed to Earl Magnus II by two
  grants, the one of North Caithness in right of his wife and the
  other of South Caithness in right of his mother. The estate of
  Sutherland was after 10th October 1237 erected into an earldom in
  the person of William, who was the eldest son of Hugo Freskyn,
  and was then owner of the estate, this earldom being, as stated
  in the Diploma of the Orkney Earls, "taken away from Magnus II"
  in his lifetime, possibly out of South Caithness, by Alexander
  II.</p>

  <p>On Magnus' death in 1239, Gillebryd or Gillebride, called in
  the Icelandic Annals Gibbon, who was either a son or younger
  brother of Magnus, succeeded Magnus II in the Orkney and
  Caithness titles and in the Paul share of the Caithness earldom,
  and it appears from a grant of the advowson of Cortachy on 12th
  December 1257 that Matilda daughter of Gillebert, "then late
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg
  117]</span> Earl of Orkney," married Malise Earl of Stratherne.
  On Gillebride's death in 1256, his son Magnus III succeeded to
  Orkney and to the share of Paul in the Caithness earldom, as held
  by Earl Magnus II and Earl Gillebride his successor, that is
  without the Sutherland earldom, and without Freskin and Johanna's
  share of Caithness.</p>

  <p>The right to succeed to the other share of Caithness, that of
  Erlend Thorfinnson, which, according to <i>The Flatey Book</i>
  had belonged to Jarl Ragnvald, and had been conferred on Harald
  Ungi by William the Lion in 1197, passed through Ragnhild,
  another and the youngest sister of Harald Ungi, and then through
  a child of hers, possibly Snaekoll Gunni's son, the only known
  male representative of this line at the time, or through
  Snaekoll's younger brother or sister, along with the Moddan
  estates in Strathnaver and in various highland and Celtic
  parishes in Caithness, to Johanna of Strathnaver as Ragnhild's
  heir; but this share did not carry with it the title of Countess.
  It was held for her in wardship, but it was not formally granted
  and confirmed by the Crown to her or her husband Freskin de
  Moravia, who had become Lord of Duffus by 1248, until their
  marriage, in or after 1245, or even later, and when the
  settlement was made, possibly South Caithness was taken partly
  out of it.</p>

  <p>If Earl John had left no daughter at all, the result in
  Caithness might well have been much the same; for in that case
  the Caithness title and lands might well have been conferred as
  to the title and a share of the earldom lands on the elder
  surviving sister of Harald Ungi, Ingibiorg or Elin, and her heir,
  while the other share without the title would go to the heir of
  the younger sister Ragnhild. But Magnus, if he had not married
  John's daughter, would not have got North Caithness, and it seems
  essential that Magnus should have married into the line of Earl
  John, in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id=
  "page118"></a>[pg 118]</span> order to found a claim on his part
  to the Jarldom of Orkney, which Harold Maddadson, David, and John
  (with whom Magnus had no relationship at all, so far as is known)
  had held in its entirety, in spite of the grant of a moiety of it
  to Harald Ungi, ever since Harald Ungi's death in 1198, and to
  the exclusion of the Erlend line from all share in Orkney, (save
  for Harald Ungi's grant) ever since Jarl Ragnvald's death in
  1158.</p>

  <p>But who will find <i>evidence to prove</i> our conjectures to
  be even approximately true?</p>

  <p>Till this is done, these matters rest upon mere conjecture,
  based mainly upon known Scottish policy, the name of "Magnus,"
  and the probable situation of the lands owned by the parent lines
  and the families known afterwards to have held them, namely, the
  families of Cheyne, Federeth, Sutherland, Keith, Oliphant, and
  Sinclair, among whose writs or inventories of them search might
  be made.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

  <h3>King Hakon and the North of Scotland.</h3>

  <p>We can now turn with some sense of relief from the intricate
  maze of the genealogy of the Caithness earls to the more open
  ground of Scottish history, which we left at the date of the
  death of William the Lion in December 1214, when he was succeeded
  on the throne of Scotland by his son, Alexander II, a youth who
  had then just entered his seventeenth year. We can then work the
  results of our genealogical conjectures into the general history
  of the northern counties.</p>

  <p>Alexander II, like his predecessors, was in the year after his
  accession immediately confronted with a revolt headed by Donald
  Ban MacWilliam the younger, another of the descendants of
  Ingibjorg of Orkney, widow of Earl Thorfinn and first wife of
  Malcolm Canmore. The scene of the rising was, as usual, Moray;
  and Donald was aided not only by the inhabitants of that
  province, but also by a large force of Irish mercenaries. This
  rebellion, however, was speedily crushed by Ferchar Mac-in-tagart
  of the family of the Lay Abbots of Applecross in the west of
  Ross, a county to which Henry, the eldest son of Harold Maddadson
  had in vain laid claim.</p>

  <p>Differences which threatened to break out between Scotland and
  England were speedily settled, and the young king, as we have
  seen, married Joanna, sister of King Henry III of England, in
  1221. Alexander next conquered the district of Argyll in 1222,
  and in the same year reduced Caithness to subjection on the
  occasion of Bishop Adam's murder, and he shortly afterwards put
  down two rebellions, the one in Moray, as above stated, and the
  other in Galloway, a district <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page120" id="page120"></a>[pg 120]</span> which, however, he did
  not finally conquer till 1235, although Mac-in-tagart was
  knighted for a victory there in 1215, and soon after, by 1226,
  became Earl of Ross.<a id="footnotetag270" name=
  "footnotetag270"></a><a href="#footnote270"><sup>1</sup></a> In
  1236, as a punishment for burning to death the Earl of Atholl, in
  revenge for the defeat of a member of their family at a
  tournament, the Bissets were deprived of their estates near
  Beauly, and fled to England, where they endeavoured to embroil
  that country again with Scotland. In this they failed, and a
  treaty was signed between the two nations that neither should
  make war on the other unless it were first attacked itself.<a id=
  "footnotetag271" name="footnotetag271"></a><a href=
  "#footnote271"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

  <p>Argyll, Galloway, and Moray being subdued and settled, and the
  old Earldom of Caithness broken up, and divided among trustworthy
  feudal tenants holding their lands by military service from the
  Scottish king, the whole of the mainland of Scotland may now be
  said to have been effectively incorporated into one kingdom under
  the Scottish Crown. Ecclesiastically, also, the whole realm was
  divided into dioceses, whose bishops were appointed by consent of
  the king.</p>

  <p>The dream of Malcolm II at last was realised.</p>

  <p>The western islands of the Hebrides, however, still owed
  allegiance to the king of Norway, who was till 1240 engaged in
  civil war with Duke Skuli in his own kingdom. Alexander II
  therefore equipped a naval expedition to reduce the islands, but,
  soon after he had embarked, he sickened and died on the island of
  Kerrera, near Oban, in 1249, leaving as his successor, his son
  Alexander III, then only in his eighth year, who was married in
  1251, before his eleventh year, to Margaret, daughter of Henry
  III of England, then a child of about the same age as himself.
  The marriage was followed by a nine years' struggle between the
  rival factions of Alan Durward, Justiciar of Scotland, and of
  Walter Comyn, Earl of Menteith, in which England constantly
  interfered, till the Comyn, or Scottish, <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg 121]</span>
  faction finally gained the upper hand. In 1261, Alexander III's
  only child Margaret, who afterwards became Queen of Norway, was
  born.</p>

  <p>Between 1242 and 1245 two Scottish bishops had been sent to
  Norway by Alexander II to induce King Hakon to give up the
  Hebrides to Scotland, and now his son Alexander III sent another
  embassy of an Archdeacon and a Scot, called in the Saga Misel,
  but more probably Frisel or Fraser, who, being found to be spies,
  tried to escape, but were caught and made to witness the young
  King Magnus' coronation in his father's lifetime.<a id=
  "footnotetag272" name="footnotetag272"></a><a href=
  "#footnote272"><sup>3</sup></a> These embassies, though backed by
  offers of money compensation, were wholly unsuccessful.</p>

  <p>Meantime affairs in Sutherland and Caithness had been pursuing
  an orderly course for nearly forty years. William, eldest son of
  Hugo Freskyn, had succeeded his father in Sutherland before 1214,
  the year of Earl David's death, and had in or after 1237 become
  its first Earl, and three years afterwards, according to
  tradition, though probably this event happened later, with the
  aid of Richard of Moray, Bishop Gilbert's brother, a Norse
  landing at Unes or Little Ferry is said to have been repulsed in
  a battle at Embo, near Dornoch in Sutherland. In this battle
  Richard fell, and the Norse Prince was also killed, the Ri-Crois
  at Embo, which has disappeared long ago, being erected in memory
  of the latter.<a id="footnotetag273" name=
  "footnotetag273"></a><a href="#footnote273"><sup>4</sup></a> Earl
  William had died in 1248, and had been buried in the Cathedral at
  Dornoch, which Bishop Gilbert had founded close to and west of
  the site of the older Church of St. Bar, and which he had
  dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary in or after 1222.</p>

  <p>The Bishop had given to his diocese of Caithness<a id=
  "footnotetag274" name="footnotetag274"></a><a href=
  "#footnote274"><sup>5</sup></a> the Constitution which is still
  extant at Dunrobin. This Constitution, like that of Elgin, was in
  the main based on that of Lincoln. But the Bishop was to be
  <i>Primus</i> and above all other dignitaries of the Cathedral.
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg
  122]</span> For it was ordained that instead of the one priest
  who had previously officiated, there should be ten Canons with
  the Bishop as their head, five of them holding the dignities of
  Dean, Precentor, Chancellor, Treasurer, and Archdeacon, each of
  them during residence to minister there daily, as well as the
  Abbot of Scone, who was a Canon, but had a Vicar to perform his
  duties in his absence. The teinds (or tithes) of certain parishes
  were allocated to each member of the Chapter; and lands,
  residences, and prebends were assigned to them, provision also
  being made from the teinds of other parishes for the lighting and
  services of the Church. Bishop Gilbert built and completed the
  Cathedral, making, it is said, the glass for its windows at
  Sidera, from sand taken from near the howe of the first Jarl
  Sigurd, a worshipper of Odin.<a id="footnotetag275" name=
  "footnotetag275"></a><a href="#footnote275"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

  <p>Bishop Gilbert had also translated the Psalms into Gaelic;
  and, having set his diocese of Caithness, comprising the modern
  counties of Sutherland and Caithness, in good working order, and
  having re-buried his predecessor Adam, with a stately funeral, at
  Dornoch in 1239, had made his will in 1242, and died in the
  episcopal palace at Scrabster, near Thurso, in 1245. It was
  probably during his episcopate that King Alexander II gave his
  open letter,<a id="footnotetag276" name=
  "footnotetag276"></a><a href="#footnote276"><sup>7</sup></a>
  directed to the sheriffs, bailies, and other good men of Moray
  and Caithness, and enjoining them to protect the ship of the
  Abbot and Convent of Scone and their men and goods from injury,
  molestation or damage in their journeys to the north. Bishop
  Gilbert was buried at Dornoch, and was succeeded by Bishop
  William,<a id="footnotetag277" name="footnotetag277"></a><a href=
  "#footnote277"><sup>8</sup></a> and he in his turn, in 1261, by
  Bishop Walter de Baltroddi, who doubtless suffered from King
  Hakon's fines levied in Caithness in 1263, and whose daughter the
  Chief of the Mackays is said to have married after that date.</p>

  <p>In 1261 the Hebrides had been harried by William, <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg 123]</span>
  MacFerchar, Earl of Ross and uncle of Freskin de Moravia the
  younger, with great cruelty and barbarity, and King Hakon in 1263
  began to collect and equip a fleet with a view to revenging the
  injury done to his subjects in the west.<a id="footnotetag278"
  name="footnotetag278"></a><a href="#footnote278"><sup>9</sup></a>
  In the preparation for this in the spring of 1263, we find Jon
  Langlifson, whose mother Langlif was Harold Maddadson's youngest
  daughter, and who was thus himself a nephew of Earl John, sent
  over with Henry Skot to Shetland to obtain pilots for King
  Hakon,<a id="footnotetag279" name="footnotetag279"></a><a href=
  "#footnote279"><sup>10</sup></a> while Dougal of the Isles met
  them in Orkney, and was let into the secret of Hakon's intended
  expedition.</p>

  <p>Meantime Earl Magnus II, being, according to our conjectures,
  a member of the Angus line, whose mother was an elder sister of
  Harald Ungi, and being also the husband of Earl John's daughter,
  had become entitled to the earldom of Orkney soon after Earl
  John's death in 1231, and probably since 1236 had held part of
  Caithness as Earl, by heirship, and by charter from the Scottish
  King. Magnus II, soon after the earldom of Sutherland had been
  taken away from him, had died in 1239. Gillebride had then
  succeeded to both the reduced Scottish earldom of Caithness and
  the whole of the Orkney jarldom as successor in the Angus line of
  Magnus II; and Gillebride had died in 1256 leaving a son Magnus
  III. Like his predecessors, Magnus III seems to have found
  himself in the awkward position of being bound to serve two
  masters who were rapidly approaching a state of war with each
  other. Freskin de Moravia, <i>dominus</i> de Duffus by 1248, who
  about that date had married the Lady Johanna, had with her
  obtained not only her lands in Strathnaver and Caithness, but
  also the bulk of the Erlend share of the earldom lands of
  Caithness, while Magnus held the rest of Caithness, and William,
  second Earl of Sutherland, then a mere boy, had succeeded to that
  earldom on his father's death in 1248.<a id="footnotetag280"
  name="footnotetag280"></a><a href=
  "#footnote280"><sup>11</sup></a></p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg 124]</span>

  <p>As already stated, Alexander II's attempt on the Sudreys had
  proved abortive through his death in 1249, and the further
  attacks on them in Alexander III's reign by William, son of
  Ferchar Mac-in-tagart, and Earl of Ross, had been made in 1261;
  and by 1262 or 1263, Freskin had died, leaving two daughters Mary
  and Christian, both minors and unmarried, to inherit his share of
  Caithness, as co-parceners, each entitled to one quarter of that
  county.</p>

  <p>Early in 1263 Magnus III of Orkney and Caithness, was in
  Bergen with King Hakon. For the Saga says,<a id="footnotetag281"
  name="footnotetag281"></a><a href=
  "#footnote281"><sup>12</sup></a> "with him from Bergen came
  Magnus, Jarl of Orkney, and the king gave him a good
  long-ship."</p>

  <p>Sailing from Norway in the end of July 1263, King Hakon found
  a fair wind, and crossed in two days to Shetland, where he lay
  for a fortnight assembling his fleet in Bressay Sound off
  Lerwick. While he was here Jon Langlifson, son of Langlif, the
  youngest daughter of Earl Harold Maddadson, brought the
  disappointing news that King John of the Sudreys had gone over to
  the side of the Scottish king, but the news was disbelieved, and
  Hakon, at the time, had every reason to think that, while he was
  sure of the support of the Orkneymen and their earl, the western
  islanders would support him to a man. Quitting Shetland,
  therefore, he sailed to Orkney, and his fleet lay first at
  Ellidarvik or Ellwick in The String off the south of Shapinsay, a
  few miles from Kirkwall. While it was here, King Hakon conceived
  the idea of sending a squadron of his ships to raid the shores of
  the Moray Firth, and there is little doubt that this project was
  aimed at the lands of the families of De Moravia in Sutherland
  and Moray. The question, however, was submitted to a council of
  the freemen of the fleet, who proved to be unwilling that any of
  them should leave their king and decided that the fleet should
  not be divided, but that the original object of the expedition,
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg
  125]</span> the reconquest of the Western Isles and West of
  Scotland, should be adhered to instead. What Earl Magnus'
  feelings on the subject were is not recorded, but it can hardly
  have been pleasing to him to find that his people in Caithness
  were to be subjected to a fine by his suzerain in Orkney, though,
  probably by his advice, the Caithness folk paid the fine exacted
  from them,<a id="footnotetag282" name=
  "footnotetag282"></a><a href="#footnote282"><sup>13</sup></a> and
  had hostages taken from them, in consequence, by the Scottish
  king.</p>

  <p>Hakon's fleet then sailed round the Mull of Deerness into the
  roadstead of Ragnvaldsvoe, in the north of South Ronaldsay, which
  is now known either as St. Margaret's Hope or possibly as
  Widewall Bay in Scapa Flow, and it was while it was there that
  the annular eclipse of the sun, ascertained by astronomical
  calculation<a id="footnotetag283" name=
  "footnotetag283"></a><a href="#footnote283"><sup>14</sup></a> to
  have taken place on the 5th August 1263, was reported by the
  writer of the Saga to have been seen by him. While the fleet was
  here, it appeared that the Orkney contingent of ships which Hakon
  had commanded to join him, were not "boun" or ready for sea, and
  Jarl Magnus accordingly "stayed behind" with his people in Orkney
  under orders to follow the main fleet.</p>

  <p>On St. Lawrence's day, the 10th of August 1263, Hakon weighed
  anchor without the jarl, or his men, and the fleet, the largest
  then ever seen in these waters, sailed from Ragnvaldsvoe into the
  Pentland Firth, and, rounding Cape Wrath on the same day,
  anchored in Asleifarvik, now corruptly called Aulsher-beg or
  Old-shore, on the west coast of the parish of Durness<a id=
  "footnotetag284" name="footnotetag284"></a><a href=
  "#footnote284"><sup>15</sup></a> in Sutherland. Thence the fleet
  ran across to the Lewis, whence it proceeded on a southerly
  course by Rona, into the Sound of Skye, and brought up at the
  Carline, now the Cailleach, Stone, in Kyleakin or the Kyle of
  Hakon. The Norse King was soon joined by King Magnus of Man, and
  Erling Ivar's son, and Andres Nicholas' son, and Halvard and
  Nicholas Tart, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id=
  "page126"></a>[pg 126]</span> the last having made no land since
  he left Norway till he sighted the Lewis. Dougal, king of the
  Sudreys also joined King Hakon, and the fleet shortly afterwards
  reached Kerrera, near Oban in the Sound of Mull. The events which
  followed are recounted, in considerable detail and with much
  exaggeration on both sides, by Scottish and Norse chroniclers,
  but it is impossible to reconcile their different versions of the
  story of the battle of Largs. Nor does such detail, save in the
  result, affect Sutherland or Caithness. Suffice it to say, then,
  that after much fruitless negotiation between the two kings,
  purposely prolonged by the Scottish monarch, a severe and
  protracted October storm drove many of the Norse ships ashore
  near Largs, where the Scots attacked their crews; and five days
  later King Hakon withdrew, and sailed with the remnants of his
  starving and shattered fleet northwards by the Sound of Mull and
  Rum and Loch Snizort in Skye, and thence round Cape Wrath, to the
  Goa-fiord or Hoanfiord, which we know as Loch Erriboll, reaching
  it on Sunday, October 28th, 1263, in a profound calm.</p>

  <p>On their way south, Erling Ivar's son, Andrew Nicolas' son,
  and Harvard the Red had<a id="footnotetag285" name=
  "footnotetag285"></a><a href="#footnote285"><sup>16</sup></a>
  "sailed into Scotland under Dyrnes, from which they went up
  country, and destroyed a castle and more than twenty hamlets."
  But on the return voyage the children of Heth were waiting for
  the invaders, and on the day<a id="footnotetag286" name=
  "footnotetag286"></a><a href="#footnote286"><sup>17</sup></a> "of
  St. Simon and St. Jude, when Mass had been sung, some Scottish
  men, whom the Northmen had taken, came. King Hakon gave them
  peace and sent them up into the country; and they promised to
  come down with cattle to<a id="footnotetag287" name=
  "footnotetag287"></a><a href="#footnote287"><sup>18</sup></a>
  him; but one of them stayed behind as a hostage. It happened that
  day that eleven men of the ship of Andrew Kuzi landed in a boat
  to fetch water. A little after, it was heard that they called
  out. Then men rowed to them from the ships, and there two of
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg
  127]</span> them were taken up, swimming much wounded, but nine
  were found on land all slain. The Scots had come down on them,
  but they all ran to the boat, and it was high and dry, and they
  were all weaponless, and there was no defence. But as soon as the
  Scots saw the boats were rowing up, they ran to the woods, but
  the Northmen took the bodies with them.</p>

  <p>"On Monday King Hakon sailed out of the Goa-fiord and let the
  Scottish man be put on shore, and gave him peace."<a id=
  "footnotetag288" name="footnotetag288"></a><a href=
  "#footnote288"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

  <p>Such is the story, so far as Sutherland and Caithness are
  concerned, of Hakon's expedition as told in his Saga, which adds
  that after losing one ship in the Pentland Firth, while another
  was all but sunk in the Swelchie near Stroma, he sheltered for
  the night in the Sound north of Osmundwall, and finally landed
  again near Ragnvaldsvoe and went to Kirkwall. Retaining twenty of
  his ships, he let such of the rest of them as had not already
  gone home sail for Norway.</p>

  <p>Deserted by his Jarl, the aged king found a home in the Palace
  of the faithful bishop, Henry of Orkney, who, alone of all Orkney
  men, had followed the fortunes of the fleet. Then King Hakon's
  health gradually failed, and after laying up his ships in Scapa
  Flow, and seeing to the welfare of his men, he lay down to die of
  a broken heart, listening as he sank to Masses indeed, but
  afterwards with greater joy to the Sagas of the Norse kings.
  "Near midnight" on the 15th of December "Sverri's Saga was read
  through. But just as midnight was past Almighty God called King
  Hakon from this world's life."</p>

  <p>His body lay in state, first in the Palace and then in the
  Cathedral of St. Magnus, where after a Solemn Mass it was
  temporarily buried in the Choir, and it was removed in his
  flag-ship to Christ Church in Bergen three months
  afterwards.<a id="footnotetag289" name=

  "#footnote289"><sup>20</sup></a></p><span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg 128]</span>

  <p>The consequence of King Hakon's failure was the immediate
  conquest of the Isle of Man and of the Hebrides by Alexander
  III.</p>

  <p>Sutherland and Caithness were saved for Scotland, it would
  seem, only by the vote of King Hakon's freemen before sailing for
  Largs, while the defeat of his fleet there led directly to the
  cession by King Magnus, his successor, under the treaty of Perth
  in 1266, of all the Western Highlands and Islands, for a payment
  of 4000 marks down and of 100 marks a year, and the treaty also
  secured their permanent political union with Scotland.</p>

  <p>Orkney and Shetland, however, remained part of Norway for two
  hundred years more, and have since 1468 been held by Scotland and
  afterwards by the United Kingdom only under a wadset or mortgage
  securing 58,000 crowns, the unpaid balance of the dower of
  Margaret, wife of James III of Scotland and daughter of King
  Christian of Norway. The right to redeem them was frequently
  though fruitlessly claimed by Norway and Denmark in succession
  until the reign of Charles II and even later; and possibly this
  right remains, to the legal mind, open until the present day.</p>

  <p>On the 20th February 1471 the Earldom of Orkney and Lordship
  of Shetland were, by an Act of the Scottish Parliament, finally
  annexed to the Scottish Crown. But Norse law and usages and the
  Norse language long lived on in Orkney and longer still in
  Shetland.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id=

  <h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

  <h3>Results and Conclusion.</h3>

  <p>Restless energy, and a religion that taught its followers that
  death in combat alone conferred on the happy warrior a title to
  immortal glory and a perpetual right to the unbroken joy of
  battle daily renewed in Valhalla drove the Viking to war.</p>

  <p>Headed off on the south by the vast army and feudal system of
  Charlemagne, this energy in war could be exercised, and its
  religious aims achieved, solely on the sea, which skill in
  shipbuilding and in navigation as well had converted from a
  barrier into a highway to the west.</p>

  <p>As already stated, over-population in the sterile lands of
  Norway, and famine probably increased by immigration from the
  east and south, drove its people "at times in piracy and at times
  in commerce"<a id="footnotetag290" name=
  "footnotetag290"></a><a href="#footnote290"><sup>1</sup></a>
  forth from the western fjords and The Vik across the North Sea to
  the opposite coasts of Scotland, and so to its western lochs and
  to Ireland, where they found cattle to slaughter on the nesses,
  stores of grain, and other booty.</p>

  <p>War, in fact, paid; and, after generations of harrying, many
  of the raiders concluded that the western lands in Britain were
  fairer and more fertile than their native shores, and desired to
  settle in the west.</p>

  <p>Finally the feudalism of Charlemagne was imitated by Harald
  Harfagr in Norway; and, against that, Norse independence revolted
  and rebelled. The true Viking would be no other man's man, and to
  secure Harald's feudal power he was driven forth from Norway by
  an organised navy manned by those of his countrymen who had
  agreed to accept King Harald as <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page130" id="page130"></a>[pg 130]</span> feudal overlord and to
  pay him tribute. Defeated, as we have seen, at the naval battle
  of Hafrsfjord in 872, the rebel remnant of the Vikings found
  their return to Norway barred; and those of them who became
  pirates in Orkney and Shetland and raided Norway as such, were,
  in their turn, assailed in these islands by King Harald, and
  destroyed. Others of them colonised Ireland, the Hebrides, and
  the Faroes; and from all these islands as well as from Scotland
  and Norway issued the swarms that settled in Iceland, and
  afterwards gave us a code of law, our system of trial by jury,
  much of our legal procedure, and, when crossed with Gaelic blood,
  produced the glorious literature of the Sagas. But in their
  exodus, whencesoever they started, what all alike sought was
  liberty; which, for them, meant the right to do exactly as they
  pleased to others, and freedom from paying "scat" or dues to a
  superior lord.</p>

  <p>When the Vikings came, they came as worshippers of Thor and
  Odin and the old Teutonic gods. To them the Christianity of the
  Pict was "a weak effeminate creed." They, therefore, slew its
  followers, plundered its shrines, and drove its clergy south from
  Orkney, from north-east Caithness and the coasts of Sutherland,
  and from the seaboard of Ross and Moray, and for a century and a
  half Christianity was uprooted and almost wholly expelled. No
  jarl before Sigurd Hlodverson was a Christian, and he was
  baptized by force, and died fighting for Odin at Clontarf. With
  all "the fury of an expiring faith, its last lambent flickering
  flame, against a creed that seemed to contradict every article of
  the old belief,"<a id="footnotetag291" name=
  "footnotetag291"></a><a href="#footnote291"><sup>2</sup></a>
  wherever they came, they destroyed the cult and culture of
  Columba, which it had taken several centuries to establish in the
  north and west of Alban.</p>

  <p>When the conquerors settled in the land, they enslaved such of
  its inhabitants as remained among them <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[pg 131]</span> for
  a time, and gave to the best coastal lands and lower valley farms
  the Norse names which they still bear, but they left the heads of
  the river valleys and the hills mainly to the Moddan family and
  their Pictish followers and clansmen, who held them tenaciously
  and extended their holdings, as the Norse became less hostile
  through inter-marriage, or less strong. Once settled, the Norse
  exerted such steady pressure on their southern Pictish neighbours
  in Ross and Moray, and kept them so fully occupied in war or by
  the constant menace of it from the north, that successive
  Scottish kings were in their turn left comparatively free, on
  their own northern frontier, from Pictish attacks, and were
  therefore enabled to consolidate their own kingdom in the south
  of Scotland and to beat the English back to the line of the
  Tweed. Afterwards they were able to turn their attention to the
  consolidation of the mainland north of the Grampians,<a id=
  "footnotetag292" name="footnotetag292"></a><a href=
  "#footnote292"><sup>3</sup></a> by first overcoming the Picts in
  Moray, and then the Norse in Cat, and establishing the feudal
  system and the Catholic Church.</p>

  <p>Worshipping, as the Vikings did, amongst others, the "fair
  white god Baldr of golden beauty," and accounting as base-born
  "hellskins" those of darker hue, it seems strange that they
  should so soon have taken to themselves Celtic wives. But we have
  seen that they came by sea and that no Norse women were allowed
  in Viking ships,<a id="footnotetag293" name=
  "footnotetag293"></a><a href="#footnote293"><sup>4</sup></a> and
  thus it was Celtic mothers alone that perpetuated the race. They
  also taught the children the Gaelic tongue, and, on the mainland
  in all Sutherland and Caithness save the north-eastern portions
  of the latter, Gaelic soon became again the only spoken
  language.</p>

  <p>But the language was Gaelic with a difference. As already
  stated, it contained, especially in connection with the sea, and
  ships, gear, and tackle, many old Norse words,<a id=
  "footnotetag294" name="footnotetag294"></a><a href=
  "#footnote294"><sup>5</sup></a> and, in the Gaelic of Sutherland,
  as in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id=
  "page132"></a>[pg 132]</span> the English of Orkney and Shetland
  and of Caithness and Moray the Old Norse roots remain. Nor need
  we believe that every Magnus or Sweyn, or Ragnvald was a pure
  Norseman. For their Celtic mothers often preferred to give their
  children Old Norse names.</p>

  <p>The Norse place-names,<a id="footnotetag295" name=
  "footnotetag295"></a><a href="#footnote295"><sup>6</sup></a> too,
  have been faithfully preserved by Gaelic inhabitants, and are
  still with us; and despite their varying spellings in documents
  of title and maps of different dates, these names generally yield
  up the secret of their original meanings when they can be traced
  back to the earliest charters, especially if they can be compared
  with the corresponding Gaelic versions of them in use at the
  present time. For Gaelic was ever a trustworthy vehicle of the
  original Norse. The Norse place-names too are found in the same
  spots on which the remains of brochs exist, that is, on the best
  land at the lowest levels which the Picts had already cultivated,
  and which the Norse invaders seized. Such names are also found on
  the eastern coast as far south as Dingwall, both in Ross and
  Cromarty. They were never imposed on the Moray seaboard, which
  was not permanently held by the Norse. Freskyn and his
  descendants saw to that. His fortress at Duffus checked all raids
  from their fort at Burghead.</p>

  <p>Of outward and visible monuments, save here and there a howe
  or grave-mound, the Vikings, unlike their Pictish predecessors,
  have left us little or nothing on the mainland. In Iceland the
  skali<a id="footnotetag296" name="footnotetag296"></a><a href=
  "#footnote296"><sup>7</sup></a> or farm-house of the Norseman was
  built with some stone and turf below, and a superstructure of
  wood which has long ago perished,<a id="footnotetag297" name=
  "footnotetag297"></a><a href="#footnote297"><sup>8</sup></a> and
  but slight traces of foundations are visible on the surface
  there. From the frequent burnings in the Saga we know that such
  houses were of highly inflammable materials which would soon
  perish. The place-name, "Skaill," remains both in Sutherland and
  Caithness. But no skilled antiquary, has as yet <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg 133]</span> laid
  bare by excavation the secrets of likely sites of Norse dwellings
  in these counties, as Mr. A.W. Johnston has done at The Jarls' Bu
  at Orphir, in Orkney.<a id="footnotetag298" name=
  "footnotetag298"></a><a href="#footnote298"><sup>9</sup></a> And
  yet, if Drumrabyn or Dunrabyn, Rafn's Ridge or Broch, be the true
  derivation of Dunrobin (and the name is found at a time when as
  yet no Robin had inhabited the place) possibly the Norse Lawman
  Rafn had a house of consequence there like his Pictish
  predecessors, if, indeed, he did not inhabit the Pictish broch
  whose foundations were found on or under the present castle's
  site. There was also a castle of note on the northern shore of
  the modern port of Helmsdale, which is probably the castle of
  Sorlinc of Mr. Collingwood's <i>William the Wanderer</i>, also
  called Surclin, both words being a corrupt form, it is suggested,
  of Scir-Illigh, the old name of the parish of Kildonan.</p>

  <p>In Caithness especially, we have many a Norse castle site,
  such as Earl Harold's borg at Thurso, and Lambaborg, the modern
  Freswick, which we know to have been inhabited by noted Norsemen,
  while, in Sutherland, Borve near Farr, and Seanachaistel on the
  Farrid Head near Durness seem to be ideal Viking sites.
  <i>Breithivellir</i><a id="footnotetag299" name=
  "footnotetag299"></a><a href="#footnote299"><sup>10</sup></a> or
  Brawl Castle was a known residence of Earl John and later earls,
  and search for foundations might well be made on the coasts of
  Caithness, and round Tongue and at the mouths of the Naver and of
  the Borgie and other rivers, and at or near Unes or Little Ferry,
  possibly at Skelbo, (Skail-bo) and in Kildonan at Helmsdale. That
  the Norsemen used many of the Pictish brochs as dwelling-places
  is more than probable, and is proved by the Sagas in certain
  instances.<a id="footnotetag300" name=
  "footnotetag300"></a><a href="#footnote300"><sup>11</sup></a> At
  the same time few articles used distinctively by Norsemen have
  been found in them.</p>

  <p>No stately church like the Cathedral of St. Magnus at
  Kirkwall, itself the finest specimen of Norman architecture
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg
  134]</span> in Scotland, survives on the mainland from Viking
  days; nor, so far as is known, was any such edifice built there
  by any Norseman; but the original High Church of Halkirk, and
  also the old church of St. Bar at Dornoch, which preceded and is
  believed to have occupied a site immediately to the east of St.
  Gilbert's later Cathedral, may have been used by the later jarls,
  and a few miles south of Halkirk are the foundations of the
  Spittal of St. Magnus,<a id="footnotetag301" name=
  "footnotetag301"></a><a href="#footnote301"><sup>12</sup></a>
  part of which, and of St. Peter's Church at Thurso may be
  Norse.</p>

  <p>Though the towns of Wick and Thurso<a id="footnotetag302"
  name="footnotetag302"></a><a href=
  "#footnote302"><sup>13</sup></a> are frequently mentioned in the
  <i>Orkneyinga Saga</i>, and earls and jarls stayed at both, no
  Sutherland village (if any save Dornoch existed) is named in it;
  but the site of modern Golspie (Gol's-by) appears in ancient
  charters as Platagall, "the Flat of the Stranger."<a id=
  "footnotetag303" name="footnotetag303"></a><a href=
  "#footnote303"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

  <p>If in his outward and visible man the Norseman has all but
  faded away in Sutherland, he remains more in evidence in
  Caithness, in spite of Celtic mothers and successive waves of
  Scottish immigration. The high Norse skull, the tall frame with
  broad shoulders and narrow hips,<a id="footnotetag304" name=
  "footnotetag304"></a><a href="#footnote304"><sup>15</sup></a> the
  fair hair and skin, the sea-blue eyes and sound teeth are still
  to be seen; and from time to time, amid greatly preponderating
  Celtic types, we are startled by coming across some perfect
  living specimen of the pure Viking type almost always on or near
  the coast.</p>

  <p>But, if the outward type is rarely seen, its inward qualities
  remain. What were those qualities?</p>

  <p>The late Professor York Powell summed up the character of the
  Viking emigrant folk in his introduction to Mr. Collingwood's
  <i>Scandinavian Britain</i>, as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"A sturdy, thrifty, hardworking, law-loving people, fond of
  good cheer and strong drink, of shrewd, blunt speech, and a
  stubborn reticence, when speech would be useless or foolish; a
  people clean-living, faithful <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page135" id="page135"></a>[pg 135]</span> to friend and kinsman,
  truthful, hospitable, liking to make a fair show, but not vain or
  boastful; a people with perhaps little play of fancy or great
  range of thought, but cool-thinking, resolute, determined, able
  to realise the plainer facts of life clearly, and even
  deeply."<a id="footnotetag305" name="footnotetag305"></a><a href=
  "#footnote305"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

  <p>Blend these qualities with those of the Gael, and what
  infinite possibilities appear; for the characteristics of the two
  races supplement each other. Fuse them together in proper
  proportions for a few generations, the improvident and dreamy
  with the thrifty and energetic, the voluble with the reticent,
  the romantic and humorous with the truthful and blunt of speech,
  the fiery and impulsive with the sober of thought, and how
  greatly is the type improved in the new race evolved from the
  union of both.</p>

  <p>Turning from eugenics to more practical matters, it was the
  brain and the manual skill of the Viking that invented and
  perfected our modern sailing ship. Stripped of its barbaric
  excrescences at stem and stern, and of its rows of shields and
  ornaments, the lines of the Viking ship of Gokstad<a id=
  "footnotetag306" name="footnotetag306"></a><a href=
  "#footnote306"><sup>17</sup></a> found there buried but entire,
  are the lines of our herring boats of fifty years ago. Sharp and
  partly decked at stem and stern only, like those boats, the
  Viking ship could live, head to the waves, even in the roughest
  sea. It was, too, a living thing, a new type of vessel handy to
  row or sail, and far in advance not only of the early British
  ship and Pictish coracle<a id="footnotetag307" name=
  "footnotetag307"></a><a href="#footnote307"><sup>18</sup></a> but
  also of the Roman galley with lines like those of a canal barge,
  and also far in advance of the Saxon ship of war or merchandise.
  The only points of difference between the older type of herring
  boat and the Viking ship were the stepping of the mast further
  forward and the use of the fixed rudder in the modern vessel.</p>

  <p>Not only did the Viking brain invent our modern ship, but it
  was the Viking spirit that impelled us as <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg 136]</span> a
  nation to use the ocean as a highway. The Norseman had discovered
  America and West Africa many centuries before Columbus or Vasco
  di Gama. The Norse colonised<a id="footnotetag308" name=
  "footnotetag308"></a><a href="#footnote308"><sup>19</sup></a>
  Greenland, Labrador, and possibly even Massachusetts, and it was
  on a voyage to Iceland that Jean Cabot heard of America, on whose
  continent he was the first modern sailor to land, and it is said
  that it was through him that Columbus, after he had discovered
  the West Indian Islands, first heard that North America had been
  proved to be a continent by Cabot's coasting voyage along its
  shore from Maine to Florida. The Vikings, too, taught us the
  discipline without which no ship can live through an ocean storm.
  Their spirit, too, when piracy had died out, led us into trade;
  for, as we have seen, the Viking was no mere pirate, but ever a
  trader as well.<a id="footnotetag309" name=
  "footnotetag309"></a><a href="#footnote309"><sup>20</sup></a>
  Their sea-fights live in story, though their traders found no
  skald or bard, and it is thus that we hear less of their trading
  or of their civic or domestic life.</p>

  <p>This spirit of theirs, like their blood, is ever with us
  still. It has gone into our race, and it keeps coming out in
  unexpected quarters. Hidden under Celtic colouring and Highland
  dress, the Viking warrior is there in spirit, glorying in battle,
  though often apparently no more of a real "Barelegs" by race than
  was kilted King Magnus. The Berserk fury and stubborn tenacity of
  our Highland regiments derive their origin from the Viking as
  well as from the Celtic strain.<a id="footnotetag310" name=
  "footnotetag310"></a><a href="#footnote310"><sup>21</sup></a> Our
  sailors too, had they been Celts, would not readily have left
  smooth water. It was Viking not Celtic blood that drove them to
  the open sea. It was Viking skill that built the ships, managed
  them in storms through Viking discipline, navigated them across
  the ocean, and gave us the naval and commercial supremacy which
  founded and preserves our empire overseas.</p>

  <p>They came to us not only from Norway direct, westwards
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg
  137]</span> across the sea. They came to us also from Normandy
  northwards through England. The first swarms of Norsemen had
  brought with them rapine and disorder. Later on the Norman came
  to the north to curb such evils, and to organise, administer, and
  rule the land. The Normans succeeded in this as signally as the
  Saxon barons, introduced under Saint Margaret, Malcolm Canmore's
  Saxon queen, had failed. David I was by education a Norman
  knight. At heart he was an ecclesiastic. As Scotland's king, he
  was, in theory, owner of Scotland's soil from the Tweed to the
  Pentland Firth, and he disposed of it to his feudal barons,
  mainly Norman, and to religious foundations on Norman lines, as
  the Norman kings of England had done there before him, in order
  to organise and consolidate his kingdom; and his successors did
  the same.</p>

  <p>Thus, as Professor Hume Brown puts it&mdash;<a id=
  "footnotetag311" name="footnotetag311"></a><a href=
  "#footnote311"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

  <p>"Directly and indirectly the Norman conquest influenced
  Scotland only less profoundly than England itself. In the case of
  Scotland it was less immediate and obtrusive, but in its totality
  it is a fact of the first importance in the national
  history."</p>

  <p>It affected Scotland in the latter part of the times which we
  have considered right up to John o' Groats. Moray was divided
  among Normans and "trustworthy natives," and the scattering of
  its Pictish population gave the Mackays to Sutherland, and,
  largely blended with the Norse, they still occupy the greater
  part of it. The Freskyns, as "trustworthy natives," were
  introduced into Sutherland, after many a fight for it, by charter
  doubtless in Norman form; and Normans won Caithness in the
  persons of the earlier Cheynes and Oliphants and St. Clairs, who,
  by inter-marriage with the descendants in the female line of a
  branch of the Freskyns, possessed themselves not only of the
  lands of the family of Moddan but of most of the mainland
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg
  138]</span> territories of the Erlend line, through Johanna of
  Strathnaver's daughters and great-grand-daughters.</p>

  <p>At a time and in an age when liberty meant licence, the order
  which the Norman introduced into the north made more truly for
  real liberty and the supremacy of law, than the individual
  independence which the Norseman had left his native land to
  preserve; and though both feudalism and the blind obedience to
  authority then enjoined by the Catholic Church are no longer
  approved or required, and have long been rightly discarded, yet
  they served their purpose in their day, by evolving from the wild
  blend of Gaels and Norsemen, which held the land, a civilised
  people free from many of the worse, and endowed with many of the
  better qualities of either race.</p><span class=

    <p>We can, however, trace many parts of "Lord" Chen's lands.

    Halkirk, 764 Latheron, 774 Wick, 787-8 Olrig, 790 Dunnet, and
    814 Canisbay. His lands in all these parishes were of
    considerable extent. They included probably the whole modern
    estate of Langwell and most of the parish of Latheron, and Wick
    up to Keiss Bay and beyond Ackergill and Riess. In Watten they
    comprised Lynegar, Dunn, Bilbster, and others: in Halkirk
    Parish, Sibster, Leurary, Gerston, Baillecaik, Scots Calder,
    North Calder, and Banniskirk; in Reay Parish, Lybster,
    Borrowstoun, Forss, and part of Skaill and Brawlbin: in Thurso,

    fishings; in Dunnet Parish, Rattar, Haland, Hollandmaik,
    Corsbach, Ham, and Swiney; while in Canisbay Parish,
    Brabstermyre, Duncansby, and Sleiklie belonged to Lord Chen.
    But neither "Lord" Chen nor Johanna ever owned Brawl, the
    principal seat of the Earls of Caithness; and the Earls of the
    Angus line had the rest, mainly in Canisbay, Bower, and the
    northern part of Wick parishes. Johanna did not own any of the
    Chen lands in the Earldom of South Caithness, which Reginald
    Chen III acquired after 1340, i.e. the parishes of Latheron and
    Wick. She probably owned the old parish of Far and Halkirk but
    not Latheron, though this is erroneously implied in the
    text.</p>

    Ri-crois. The story that Dornoch took its name from the slaying
    of this Chief with the leg of a horse is quite unfounded, for
    the name Durnach appears in a charter about a hundred years
    earlier, and has nothing to do with a "horse's hoof." Its
    derivation and meaning are alike obscure. Chalmers,
    <i>Caledonia</i>, v, p. 192, gives to Dornock in Dumfriesshire
    the derivation "Dur-nochd" or the "bare" or "naked water." Its
    situation is like that of Dornoch, with a wide expanse of tidal
    sands.</p>

    <p>See Tudor, <i>Orkney and Shetland</i>, p. 307. What happened
    to Earl Magnus III, who in July 1263 had been obliged to join
    his overlord, King Hakon, and sail with him from Bergen? The
    Orkneymen were far from Norway, but dangerously close to
    Scotland. Their jarl had large possessions in Caithness, which
    he feared to lose if he made war on the Scottish king. Magnus
    therefore "stayed behind" in Orkney, and never went to Largs,
    but probably went to the Scottish king. Caithness first
    suffered from levies of cattle and provisions at the hands of
    Hakon, and afterwards from fines levied and hostages taken by
    the Scottish King, who sent an army, no doubt under the Chens
    and Federeths and others, to threaten Orkney and hold Caithness
    and levy the fine. Dugald, king of the Sudreys, intercepted the
    fine, and disappeared. Orkney had a Norse garrison, and the
    Scottish army never went to Orkney, Magnus was reconciled to
    Alexander III, and after the Treaty of Perth, in 1267, was
    reconciled also to King Magnus of Norway, on terms that he
    should hold Orkney of him and his successors, but that Shetland
    should remain a direct appanage of the Norse Crown, as it had
    been ever since Harold Maddadson's punishment in 1195. (See
    Munch's <i>History of Norway</i>; and <i>Torfaeus Orcades</i>,
    p. 172; and <i>King Magnus Saga</i>, Rolls edition of
    <i>Hakon's Saga</i>, pp. 374-7).</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
